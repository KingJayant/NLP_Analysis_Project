            "['“Masters of the Air,” a 2024 American war drama miniseries, heralds a new chapter in streaming television. Crafted by the creative duo John Shiban and John Orloff, and further developed by Orloff for Apple TV+, this series marks a significant addition to the platform’s offerings. The narrative is rooted in Donald L. Miller’s 2007 book, “Masters of the Air: America’s Bomber Boys Who Fought the Air War Against Nazi Germany.” It vividly recounts the harrowing experiences of the 100th Bomb Group, a B-17 Flying Fortress squadron in the Eighth Air Force during World War II. Known infamously as the “Bloody Hundredth,” this group was distinguished by the severe casualties it suffered in the thick of battle.', '“Masters of the Air” stands as a companion piece to the esteemed series “Band of Brothers” (2001) and “The Pacific” (2010), completing a trilogy of sorts in war-time storytelling. Notably, it is the first series to be produced by Apple Studios, in collaboration with Playtone and Amblin Television, showcasing a significant investment in quality historical drama.', 'The production, which commenced in England in 2021, faced numerous setbacks due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite these challenges, “Masters of the Air” successfully premiered on January 26, 2024, demonstrating resilience and commitment to bringing a pivotal era of history to the screen.', '* * *', 'The premiere episode of “Masters of the Air” introduces key members of the 100th Bomb Group during World War II, such as Gale “Buck” Cleven and John “Bucky” Egan. The episode, blending fact with fiction, confirms some historical details, like the B-17 Flying Fortress named “Alice from Dallas,” but leaves others, such as Bucky’s narwhal tusk incident, ambiguous. Key plotlines involve challenging landings, airsickness leading to navigational errors, and the introduction of a dog named Meatball. The episode culminates in the 100th Bomb Group’s first mission, a disastrous affair resulting in significant losses, mirroring historical events. Personal struggles are also depicted, including a soldier’s hands freezing to his gun and a colonel’s unexplained illness, likely drawn from personal anecdotes rather than public records.', '* * *', '[captains sigh]', '[captain 1] Two more.', '[bartender] Coming right up.', 'Bucky’s got all the luck.', 'Yeah, she’s pretty.', 'No, not that.

The finale reflects the series’ spirit of small-town life, with its quirky characters and unique humor.', 'The episode starts with a nostalgic cold open discussing local gossip and bird misconceptions, capturing the show’s typical banter. It then revisits the previous night’s events, where the gang successfully thwarts the Degens with a surprise attack, hinting at the never-ending battle between them.

The rave at the Ag Hall becomes a significant event, bringing together the community in a joyous celebration, with everyone dancing and reminiscing.

Crafted by the creative duo John Shiban and John Orloff, and further developed by Orloff for Apple TV+, this series marks a significant addition to the platform\\u2019s offerings. The narrative is rooted in Donald L. Miller\\u2019s 2007 book, \\u201cMasters of the Air: America\\u2019s Bomber Boys Who Fought the Air War Against Nazi Germany.\\u201d It vividly recounts the harrowing experiences of the 100th Bomb Group, a B-17 Flying Fortress squadron in the Eighth Air Force during World War II. Known infamously as the \\u201cBloody Hundredth,\\u201d this group was distinguished by the severe casualties it suffered in the thick of battle. \\u201cMasters of the Air\\u201d stands as a companion piece to the esteemed series \\u201cBand of Brothers\\u201d (2001) and \\u201cThe Pacific\\u201d (2010), completing a trilogy of sorts in war-time storytelling. Notably, it is the first series to be produced by Apple Studios, in collaboration with Playtone and Amblin Television, showcasing a significant investment in quality historical drama. The production, which commenced in England in 2021, faced numerous setbacks due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite these challenges, \\u201cMasters of the Air\\u201d successfully premiered on January 26, 2024, demonstrating resilience and commitment to bringing a pivotal era of history to the screen. * * * The premiere episode of \\u201cMasters of the Air\\u201d introduces key members of the 100th Bomb Group during World War II, such as Gale \\u201cBuck\\u201d Cleven and John \\u201cBucky\\u201d Egan. The episode, blending fact with fiction, confirms some historical details, like the B-17 Flying Fortress named \\u201cAlice from Dallas,\\u201d but leaves others, such as Bucky\\u2019s narwhal tusk incident, ambiguous. Key plotlines involve challenging landings, airsickness leading to navigational errors, and the introduction of a dog named Meatball. The episode culminates in the 100th Bomb Group\\u2019s first mission, a disastrous affair resulting in significant losses, mirroring historical events. Personal struggles are also depicted, including a soldier\\u2019s hands freezing to his gun and a colonel\\u2019s unexplained illness, likely drawn from personal anecdotes rather than public records. * * * [captains sigh] [captain 1] Two more.

I don\\u2019t know if John Egan\\u2019s the pen pal type. Hmm. Well, maybe if he met a girl worth writing to, he would be. Ah. Well, a girl worth writing to is hard to find. Not if you know where to look. Ah. I see what you mean. Mm-hmm. Hmm. So, you\\u2019ll write me? Well, I already have. You wrote me a letter? Yeah. What\\u2019s it say? Well, you\\u2019ll have to wait and find out. [chuckles] Well, when will that be? Mmm. When I ship out. I\\u2019d say two or three weeks. I\\u2019m gonna miss you every second.

[patron 1] Hey, hey. [patron 2] All right, Major. [captain 1] Of all the drunks in the 100th. Well, someone\\u2019s got to make a nest for the rest of you dodos. Cheers, Major. [patron 1] To the 100th. [patron 3] Yeah, to the 100th. [patron 4] Best of luck, sir. [sighs] Thanks. [captain 2] Save some Krauts for us. We\\u2019re going to Slooter\\u2019s. You guys coming? Nah, I-I gotta fly early. [captain 2] Buck? I don\\u2019t think so, boys. See you tomorrow then. Bye, Marge. Bucky, see you in England. And remember, I want extra blankets and a cot with a view. [groans] Consider it done. He won\\u2019t tell me. What\\u2019s with the nicknames? [chuckles] [friend] Spill, Marge. Yeah? Go ahead. Go ahead. Okay. [Bucky] Told you, it\\u2019s a long story. Well, they met in basic training before the war started. John, uh\\u2026 John was always Bucky since he was a kid. Right? That\\u2019s right, yeah. And Gale\\u2026 Well, Gale\\u2019s always been Gale. Until\\u2026 First day of basic training, this fella walks up to me and says that I remind him of a guy back home in, uh, Wisconsin, goes by the name of Buck. I tell him my name\\u2019s Gale, Gale Cleven. [both chuckle] And, uh\\u2026 But Bucky here, he\\u2019s not deterred. No, sir. It\\u2019s, uh\\u2026 It\\u2019s just \\u201cBuck this, Buck that.\\u201d \\u201cBuck, can you help me tie my shoes?\\u201d \\u201cBuck, help me fly this plane.\\u201d [chuckles] Before I know it, the whole damn Eighth Air Force is calling me Buck. So\\u2026 What kind of a name is Gale anyway? Oh. [gasps] [Bucky] You know what? You\\u2026 You know what? You should actually be thanking me. I did you a favor. For giving me the same name as you? It\\u2019s not exactly the same name, and it\\u2019s not my fault you look exactly like Buck from Manitowoc, Wisconsin. From Manitowoc. What kind of man does that to his best friend? Aw, it\\u2019s so sweet. [chuckles] Mmm. We need music. Okay. Don\\u2019t go away, Gale\\u2026 Mmm. Buck. You\\u2019re gonna dance with me before this night is through. Oh, don\\u2019t make me dance, Marge. [chuckles, kisses] [Bucky] Pick a good one. Mmm. Artie Shaw, Benny Goodman. [Marge laughs] Hey. You know, I am amazed that we\\u2019re friends. You don\\u2019t like to dance with a beautiful woman. You don\\u2019t drink. You don\\u2019t gamble. You don\\u2019t even like sports. Well, we are one of life\\u2019s great mysteries. [scoffs] [Marge chuckling] [\\u201cBegin the Beguine\\u201d playing] [chuckling] Oh, I love that. Yes. [friend] Yeah? [Marge chuckles] [sighs] Hmm. So this is it. [sighs] This is it. I\\u2019ll see you in a few weeks. If I don\\u2019t die first. Hate to break it to you, Bucky, but you are the 100th\\u2019s Air Executive now. You\\u2019re not going over there to fly missions. Look, I, uh\\u2026 I had a conversation with the CO over at the 389th, and I\\u2019m flying with those boys until you guys show up. I\\u2019ll be an observation pilot. You son of a bitch. Mm-hmm, yeah. Well, someone\\u2019s gotta taste a little combat, tell you what it\\u2019s really like up there. Well, don\\u2019t you die on me before I get over there. Don\\u2019t count on it. [Bucky] Keep your nose down! Let\\u2019s get this fire out! [pilot] Come on, faster! You have to help us! That\\u2019s it! The fire is out! Pull! Pull up! Up! [pilot shouting] Harder! [grunting, shouting] [pilot] Okay, leveling out! Almost there! [Bucky grunts] Fighters, 12:00! Dead ahead! [pilot] Oh, shit! We\\u2019ve lost the fourth flap. Pilot to navigator. We gotta head back. We need a new heading! Fuck! This is Duval. [grunting] And I\\u2019ve been hit. [Bucky] I\\u2019m coming down to you, Duval. Point it due west. Roger! We\\u2019re losing oil pressure on engine two! [Bucky] Keep it steady and I\\u2019ll get a new heading. [breathing shakily] Breathe, man! Just breathe! Hang on! [Duval grunting] Duval! Where are you hit? [shouts] Ah, fuck. Stay with me, Duval! [grunting] I\\u2019m right here. I\\u2019m not gonna make it, Bucky. [shouts] Stop it, Duval. You\\u2019re gonna make it. [grunts] Put your hand on the wound. [mumbles] Here. That\\u2019s good. [Duval] Okay. Okay. All right? Stay with me, goddamn it! [breathing heavily, shouts] You hear me? Look at me! Open your eyes! Open your eyes! Breathe, breathe, breathe! [breathing heavily, grunts] [pilot] Fighters, 12:00! [sergeant] Got one! [pilot] Egan, I need that heading! [Bucky] New heading: Turn left at 248. Roger! Come on. Stay with me. [Duval grunts] [Bucky] We\\u2019re headed home. Yeah. Yeah. Just keep breathing! [panting] [choking, gasping] That was a hell of an observation mission, Major. Are they all like that? You wondering what to tell your guys? Don\\u2019t say anything. They\\u2019ll figure it out. We all do. [airplanes passing] [crew member] The 100th bomb group was sent to England in the spring of 1943 to join the US Army\\u2019s Eighth Air Force in its battle against Nazi Germany. [lieutenant] I say we call this fort Alice From Dallas. Alice From Dallas? It\\u2019s got a ring to it. Alice From Dallas. Alice, our palace. Show Major Cleven. Lorch, show the major. I want her back. Hell of a dame. She\\u2019ll give this fort a little extra muscle. Oh. [chuckles] I see why you\\u2019d wanna name this fort after her. Aw, she\\u2019s special. She\\u2019s formidable. Amison, you sure you got us to the right fjord? Roger. 100%. [lieutenant] Nutting, how we looking back there? Eight in a line, sir. [lieutenant] Roger. [crew member] Most of us had never traveled far from home, let alone flown in an airplane. We came from every corner of the country, with a common purpose: to bring the war to Hitler\\u2019s doorstep. [Buck] Pilot to crew. We\\u2019ll be touching down in Greenland shortly to get some chow and some rest. Blondie Tower, Army 233. A flight of B-17s over Bluie West One. Landing instructions, please. [landing officer] Army 233, flight Blondie Tower. Continue for runway six. Clear to land. Sky CAVU. Winds 330 at 40, gusting to 50. Altimeter 2-niner-niner-0. It\\u2019s a little breezy. Breezy? In \\u2018Bama, we call that a hurricane. Roger, Blondie Tower. Continuing to runway six. Sky CAVU. Winds of 330 to 40, gusting to 50. [landing officer] Hell of a crosswind. Gusts increasing, fellas. Be careful. You might want to circle around, Major. Welcome to Greenland. Landing gear down. Get ready on flaps. [lieutenant] Landing gear coming down. It\\u2019s gonna get bumpy. Hang on, guys. [Buck] Pilot to crew. Prepare for landing. Left gear down. [grunts] Right\\u2019s down. Final-approach checks. Flaps at quarter? Yeah. Flaps at quarter. [grunting] Flaps at half. [lieutenant] Flaps are half. [crew members grunting] Flaps up. Got \\u2019em. [Buck] You gotta pull up, Veal. Come back around. [crew member] Our unit was made up of four squadrons. Major Gale Cleven was the commander of the 350th. He and Major Egan were the unquestioned leaders of our entire group. Ev Blakely was a pilot from Seattle. Look who it is. Blakely. [crew member] And big-hearted Benny DeMarco, from Philly. Major. DeMarco. Hell of a landing. Seen worse. Is that the fight? [Amison] Yeah. Claytor, you got money on this, right? I do. It\\u2019s bad signal though, man. Yeah, you don\\u2019t say. Well, turn it up. [crew member] Bombardiers James Douglass and Howard Hamilton were from the Midwest. Hambone. Major. Yep. [Claytor] Calm down. I got it. [crew member] And Charles Cruikshank, also known as Crank, was from New England. Hiya, Crank. Heard you boys had a rough landing. [crew member] My best friend Joe \\u201cBubbles\\u201d Payne and I were navigators, so location was important to us. Uh, Major? Lieutenant Crosby. Uh, where are you from? Yeah, we gotta put a pin in it. Bubbles and I\\u2026 we\\u2019re, yeah, you know, keeping the tradition alive. Got guys from all parts. Yeah. [chuckles] Ah. Casper, Wyoming. Cowboy State, huh? [chuckles] [Buck] Yep. Well, it looks like you\\u2019re the first, Major. How about that. [officers cheering, chattering] Major. What can I get for ya? A buddy of mine came through here some weeks ago. Group Air Exec. Uh, there was an incident. You friends with Egan? Major John Egan? Bucky? I am. Yeah. Whatever he said, I didn\\u2019t do anything wrong. No, he\\u2026 he just wanted me to give you this. Said it\\u2019s a replacement. A replacement? Yeah. [scoffs, sighs] [scoffs] And how exactly is this supposed to be a replacement? Sergeant, I don\\u2019t know what went on, but he told me that that should make up for it. You see that? Broken narwhal tusk? He pulled it down off the wall, pretended to be a unicorn. Ripped two of my couches, broke almost every glass in the bar. I see. You know, usually I can spot a troublemaker, but your friend seemed fine. Till he started to sing. Yeah, that sounds about right. \\u266a I asked her for credit She answered me nay \\u266a \\u266a Such a customer as you I can have any day \\u266a \\u266a And it\\u2019s no, nay, never \\u266a You don\\u2019t have to do this. It\\u2019s a stupid bet. \\u266a No, nay, never, no more \\u266a I have to now. \\u266a Will I play\\u2026 \\u266a [patron 1] Who\\u2019s it gonna be? All right, all right. [patron 1] Who\\u2019s it gonna be? [shushing] Now, I\\u2019ve played every one of ya\\u2026 [clears throat] \\u2026and you Irish are about as good at hitting that bull\\u2019s-eye as you are at hammering your nails. [patrons clamoring, laughing] I don\\u2019t know why you\\u2019re laughing. You English ain\\u2019t much better. Jack! But Tommy here, Tommy here is the best damn dart slinger in the whole of East Anglia! You\\u2019ll lose an eye. No, I won\\u2019t. I trust Tommy. [sighs] Now, he wins this, I get both those bikes. Yeah. You\\u2019re on, Yank. [Bucky] Both of \\u2019em. [patron 2] All right, both of them. And I get a kiss. All right, Tommy. Not my eyes. Not my eyes, Tommy. All right? [breathing deeply] [patron 3] Come on, Tommy. [breathing deeply] Whoo! All right, Tommy. Whenever you\\u2019re ready. [patrons cheering, laughing] [shouting] I just lost two bloody bikes, Tommy. What\\u2019s the matter with you? Tommy! [laughing] \\u266a Nothing but blue skies Do I see \\u266a \\u266a Not in England though Got shitty weather and blue skies \\u266a \\u266a Smiling at me \\u266a Evening, Major. Is that bike for sale? Not for all the money in the world. [Crosby] It was my job to get Captain Brady and the rest of our crew from Greenland to our base at Thorpe Abbotts in England. But somehow, we were separated from the rest of our group in the clouds over the Atlantic. Tough enough with zero visibility, but I had another problem: uncontrollable air sickness. [vomiting] [Brady] We have an electrical problem. We need a heading. Crosby, you there? Sorry. Could you repeat that? We got a gremlin in the electrical. Give us a holding pattern while we figure this out, Croz. Roger. Stand by. Turn right to 165. Over. [Brady] Roger. Turning right to 165. Shutting off electrical and recycling it. Let\\u2019s fix this. It\\u2019s gotta be one of the control circuits. I\\u2019ll pull the fuses. That\\u2019ll isolate the problem. Right. Go. [Hambone] How are you still vomiting? Your stomach\\u2019s gotta be as empty as our fuel tank. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. [laughs] [gasps] [Hambone] Ugh! Oh, gosh darn it, Croz. I\\u2019m sorry. It\\u2019s all over me. Get me a rag. I\\u2019m sorry, I\\u2019m sorry, I\\u2019m sorry. Come on. It stinks. [Brady] Come on. You got it? No gremlin as far as I can see. Maybe a problem with the wheel motor. [Brady] Restarting batteries and generators. [flips switch] Back on. Warning lights off. Is that the coast of England? Crosby, that\\u2019s England, right? Uh. No, we\\u2026 we shouldn\\u2019t be over water, Lieutenant. Sir, what\\u2019s your heading? 165, like you told me. Oh, good Lord in Heaven. Son of a bitch. That\\u2019s France! [explosions] Pilot to crew, flak ahead. Hold on. Shit! Goddamn it, Croz. [exhales sharply] [belches] [people chattering] [horn honks] [Bucky] Morris. Thanks for the bikes. I\\u2019ll get you next time. [laughs] Come on. [clicks tongue] There you go, lovely. Keep that way. Ooh, oh. Go on, girl. Here they come. [chattering] [children laughing] Come on, boy. DeMarco! Hey, Major. [Bucky] Where did you get that dog, Benny? I won him at craps. You took this baby above 10,000 feet. He\\u2019s got a mask. It cost me three bucks. But boy, he loves to fly. He wouldn\\u2019t stop howling. That\\u2019s because he\\u2019s part wolf. [chuckles] That wolf\\u2019s part dog. Got a name? Meatball. Welcome to the 100th, Meatball. Come on, Meatball. You miss me? Like a stone in my shoe. [laughs] How you been getting on? Uh, half our equipment\\u2019s yet to show up. Had to borrow masks and parachutes from the Brits. Air Exec ought to take care of that. My opinion: They ought to can the guy. Also, get used to the mud. Hey, listen, your, uh\\u2026 your radio guy pick up any chatter from the 418th? We\\u2019re missing Brady. Negative. Oh, I got you a bike. I need a bike? Or it\\u2019s a 20-minute walk from the quarters to the mess. And these things are sold out for weeks. I figure you\\u2019ll buzz past a bunch of guys crawling through the rain on the way to dinner. You\\u2019ll come around and say, \\u201cThank you, Bucky.\\u201d Don\\u2019t count on it. Well, there\\u2019s Brady. Okay, let\\u2019s check the landing gear. Bring it down. Roger. Left coming down. Tail down. Negative on right. Fuck. Right wheel won\\u2019t come down. Blum, get on the manual crank. [Blum] I\\u2019m on it. Hafer, you help him out. Roger, wilco. Take that. Where\\u2019s the crank? Come on. [grunts] [grunting] [Blum grunting] It won\\u2019t budge. Come on. [Blum] I\\u2019m trying. Come on. Get out of the way. Come on. Give it here. You got it? Yeah. [grunting] The landing gear motor must be fried or the jackscrew\\u2019s jammed up. You sure? [Blum] Yes, sir. [groans] It\\u2019s completely frozen. It\\u2019s not coming down. Bring the left landing gear up. You sure? Yeah, we got a better shot at walking away from a belly landing than we do on one wheel. Clear-up Tower, this is Army 071. Landing gear not responding. Requesting landing instructions. Over. [tower operator] Roger, Army 071, clear to land. Rescue crew at the ready. Over. [copilot] Roger, Clear-up. [Brady] Pilot to crew, prepare for crash landing. [Hafer] You hear that? Come on. Let\\u2019s go. Let\\u2019s go. [announcer] 247. Emergency personnel\\u2026 [soldiers clamoring, shouting] [grunting] [grunts] [breathes heavily] Okay. Get out! Everybody out. [Blum] Let\\u2019s go, go, go! Get the fuck out of here! Move! Move! Go, go, go, go. [siren blaring] Go, go! Come on! Get a move on. Run now or you\\u2019re dead. Go, go! [sirens continue] [emergency worker] All clear. [panting] Oh, fuck. Easy deal. Jack it up and hook it up. I\\u2019m on it. Let\\u2019s go. You\\u2019re a navigator, Crosby. You should be able to, I don\\u2019t know, find England. Everyone okay? Yes, sir. Sir. Brady. Step into my office. How\\u2019d you lose the rest of the squadron? We, uh\\u2026 We got separated in clouds. And, um, then we had some kind of electrical failure, so we spent an hour just trying to get the wheel down. Well, you know what they say. There are two kinds of pilots, those who have had a wheels-up landing and those who will. Major, it looks worse than it is. [Bucky] All right. Sort it out. [crew member 2] On it, Major. You didn\\u2019t have to cover for me, okay. It was my responsibility. I should\\u2019ve\\u2026 I wasn\\u2019t covering for you. We had a mechanical failure. Get a grip on that airsickness. Or get off my plane. [softly] Yes, sir. Croz, you take the scenic route? So, you wanna tell me about this unicorn story? Well, the unicorn is my favorite extinct animal. France? How the hell did you manage that? How else, Bubbles? [stammers] Puking my goddamn guts out. I thought that went away once you got going. [Crosby] No, yeah, it usually does. But this time with the turbulence, it kinda\\u2026 [stammers] \\u2026I don\\u2019t know. [sighs] This time it didn\\u2019t. [grunting] I gotta be the worst navigator in the entire Army Air Force. [grunts] Oh, Crosby, there\\u2019s gotta be somebody worse. [Bucky] Whoa. Hey. [Bubbles] At least one. Wrong side of the road, Lieutenant. [Crosby] Sir. [Bucky] Welcome to England. Now, you ask me, those two have watched Test Pilot a few too many times. You watched Test Pilot a few too many times. Yeah. [sighs] Didn\\u2019t help. Well, at least we get to tell \\u2019em which direction to point the plane. [Bucky] See ya, Buck. [Buck] Thanks for the lift. Normally the direct route. In your case, the scenic route. [Crosby] Oh, the scenic route? Oh, very funny. I wouldn\\u2019t have assumed I\\u2019d need to explain to you the gravity of your responsibilities. You are aware this isn\\u2019t just about how well your crews make their beds. I am, sir. Which is why I prioritize the flying more than their folding. You are in charge of 35 planes and 350 aircrewmen. Boys who have yet to experience combat. Their lives depend on order and discipline and your example. Yes, sir. [sighs] With all due respect\\u2026 I think I would be of more use to them and you as a squadron commander, rather than an Air Exec. Just because you spin the baton at the front doesn\\u2019t make you the band leader. I just don\\u2019t think I was made to sit behind a desk. I need to be up there helping my guys. Colonel LeMay has us in his sights. And he\\u2019s just itching to pull the trigger on the 100th Bomb Group. That\\u2019s not gonna happen on my watch. And I expect all officers to get in the game with me. That means you, Major Egan. You\\u2019re dismissed. [sighs] [retches] [groans] [breathing heavily] [guard] You okay, sir? Should I call the doctor? I\\u2019m all right. [breathes heavily] [Crosby] Within days, they woke us up for our first mission. With hundreds of hours of flight training in the States, we had to believe we were prepared. We had to, because now it was real. [soldier] Sir. Sir, you\\u2019re flying today. Major Cleven, sir. [Crosby] There was always a special breakfast on mission days: eggs, French toast, flapjacks, double rations of bacon, fresh grapefruit juice and a couple of cups of GI coffee. The men would come to call it the last supper. I hope we all we get back okay from\\u2026 Chuck, can you pass the salt, please? Uh-oh. [soldier] Oh, shit. He spilled the salt. [chuckles] Would you please toss the salt over your shoulder, so we can all get on with our breakfast? [shaker shatters] [soldier 2] Who did that? [soldier 3] Jesus. Not the whole thing, Chuck. [soldier 4] Doesn\\u2019t bring us bad luck. You said toss the salt. [soldier 2] Moron. He said toss the salt. Curt, I\\u2019m flying with you today. [DeMarco] Here you go. You\\u2019re what? Sorry, Dick. I know that puts you in the tail, but at least you\\u2019ll be able to shoot back. It\\u2019s all right. Is Meatball saddling up? Lemmons or Wink will watch him. You don\\u2019t wanna go on this one, buddy. I promise you. Well, I better get some of those eggs before they\\u2019re all gone. No, don\\u2019t bother, Buck. These eggs were hatched and powdered before my balls dropped. [chuckles] All right. I\\u2019ll pass on the eggs then. Morning, boys. [soldiers] Major Veal. Morning, sir. How\\u2019d you sleep? [sighs] Fucking great. Like a fucking baby. The new CO flying with us? The new CO, or the new, new CO? [soldiers laughing] Don\\u2019t worry about the CO. Worry about your flying. I want formation so damn tight you wouldn\\u2019t be able to slip a dime through our wingtips. [soldier 5] Yes, sir, Major Veal. [soldier 6] Yes, sir. Ah-ten-hut. [colonel] As you were. The target for today is Bremen. [soldiers clamor, laugh, whistle] We\\u2019ll be hitting the U-boat pens on the Weser River. Now, I cannot stress enough the importance of this target. We lost almost 70 cargo ships to U-boats last month alone. And if we can\\u2019t get material from the United States to Great Britain, we won\\u2019t be stepping foot on the continent. The 350th will be in high position with Major Cleven as lead pilot, and the 349th will be low with Major Veal as lead. I\\u2019ll be up front with Lieutenant Dye in the 351st. After formation, the 100th will join the 94th, the 95th, and the 96th bomber groups. We will be in the low-low. [soldiers sigh, whisper] Tail-end Charlie. [colonel] In a total wing strength of 78 heavy bombers. Fuck. Major Bowman, our Intelligence Officer, will take it from here. And Captain Becker will finish up with the weather. Major. [Bowman] Thank you, sir. Lights, please. [colonel] There you go. Note both naval and ground-based flak positions along the Frisian Islands, from Norderney to Langeoog. Over the mainland, you can expect concentrated flak from Wilhelmshaven, all the way down to Bremen. Identified batteries consist of 88 and 105 millimeter guns guided by W\\u00fcrzburg radar, so they will be tracking you. Navigators, bombardiers, once we\\u2019ve wrapped up here, be sure to report to HQ for a specialized briefing. Now, your IP is on the northwest side of Bremen, here. Target map, please. From that initial point, it\\u2019s a straight nine-mile run to the target. These are the pens on the east side of the river. Now, this central pen here will be your mean point of impact. And your heading on to the run-up will be 218 degrees true. Immediately after the turn, follow the river. Here you go, Major. Thank you. [Dick] Come on, Curt. [sighs] What\\u2019s your quote for the day? I\\u2019m gonna fly like an angel today, and not die like one. [chattering] Major, I think it\\u2019s too small. I can\\u2019t get it on. Thanks. There you go. Buck, give me a hand with this sheepskin. Yeah. [crew member 3] You good? You got this. We got this. I like your aftershave. Good. This is how close I want you on my wing today. Just like we trained for. Yes, sir. [person] Good morning, gentlemen. For those who don\\u2019t know me, I\\u2019m Father Teska. I\\u2019m right across the way\\u2026 Captain Phillips too, if anyone needs us. Thank you, Padre. We\\u2019ll be sure to keep that in mind. Mmm. [Bucky] Buck. Hey. You all right? [Buck] Yeah. What\\u2019s this? You settling accounts? It\\u2019s my lucky deuce. Your lucky\\u2026 Jesus, John. Here. Take it. I\\u2019ve gone on two missions with it already. I had two wheels down. Look, two corners bitten off. One for each mission. Here I am. Take it. [Curt] Get on in here. For luck. All right. [blowing kisses] See you later. [blows kisses] All right. See you all later. That\\u2019s where I\\u2019m going. Let\\u2019s circle up. As you know, it\\u2019s our first mission here. I trust you all to remember your training and know your jobs. Let\\u2019s knock one off, and drop bombs on those Nazi fucks, and we get to go home early. [crew] Yes, sir! Major here is gonna be flying with us. Major? First time in the sawmill, boys. Let\\u2019s rack \\u2019em up and knock \\u2019em down. [crew] Yes, sir. All right. Why are we still standing here then? [Buck] Everything okay back here, Dickie? Are you kidding? It\\u2019s cozy as a suite at the Ritz. [chuckles] Thank you. [sniffs, sighs] Gentlemen. Sir. We\\u2019re blessed to have you on our plane, sir. I feel the spirit of God in you. Yeah, in all of us, pal. You saved my seat. Yeah. Rather offer it to you than have you sit on my lap till I move. Ready for the checklist. [Curt] Form 1A? Check. Fuel transfer valves and switches? Both transfer valves are off and switch is off. Intercoolers are cold. Gyros? [lieutenant] Fuel shutoff switches? All four open. Cowl flaps? Open left and locked. Throttles? Throttles are closed. Master and ignition switches? Batteries on. And check. Booster pumps, pressure? [Dye] Pumps on. Fuel quantity, good. All right, Lieutenant, you ready to start engines? Yes, sir. Start one. Good to have you with us, Colonel. [engine starts] [Curt] Start two. Start two. Fuel pressure, oil pressure looking good. Start three. [Crosby] The B-17 had 12 machine guns protecting us from every side. We called it the Flying Fortress. But the key to our survival was sticking together, creating a combat box of defensive fire from a tight formation. It was important because if we got separated, the German fighters could pick us off one by one. [soldiers cheering] Give \\u2019em hell, boys! [cheering continues] Show \\u2019em green. [colonel] Here we go, fellas. [engine rumbling] Sixty. Ninety. 100. 110. Okay, boys. Here we go. [engine rumbling] [Curt] Forty. Fifty. Sixty. [cheering] Ninety. 100, 110. [Buck] Still climbing, boys. Three hours before we hit the target. After-takeoff checklist. Climb power is set. Cowl flaps are good. Right gear is up. [Buck] Left gear\\u2019s up. [sergeant] Tail wheel up. Okay, Bosser, let\\u2019s get you in the hole. [Buck] Okay, Curt, I got control. Pilot to crew. 10,000 feet. Masks on and check in. [Bosser] Ball turret, roger. Tail, roger.

He was-I mean, he was a little weird, but\\u2026 he was crazy about her. But Annie changed when they started goin\\u2019 out. Evangeline: Changed how? Susan: She didn\\u2019t want anybody to know they were together. And that was weird. Evangeline: You could\\u2019ve told me back then. I would\\u2019ve protected you. Susan: I was terrified. Plus, I was seeing a guy from Tsalal. Liz: Wait\\u2026 who? Susan: Oliver Tagaq. Liz: Oh, there-there\\u2019s, there\\u2019s no Oliver that works at Tsalal. Susan: He was the equipment engineer. He left right before Annie died. Liz: Um\\u2026 and, um\\u2026 do you know where we could find this Oliver? Susan: Last I heard, somewhere out on the ice. Probably hunting. I don\\u2019t think he\\u2019s lookin\\u2019 to be found. (deep breath) After they found her, I did call the police. I just didn\\u2019t wanna talk to you \\u2019cause you\\u2019da known me. So, I didn\\u2019t leave my name. But I told \\u2019em about Clark. Evangeline: Who\\u2019d you talk to? Liz: Prior, where\\u2019s your dad? Over. Peter (over radio): He\\u2019s still out in the search, Chief. Evangeline: There\\u2019s plenty of radio signal out there, he\\u2019s hidin\\u2019 his ass. Peter: I\\u2019ll get him to call the minute he gets back. Liz: Yeah, okay, you do that, and, um, see if you can find an Oliver Tagaq. He was an engineer six years ago at Tsalal. Got that? Peter: On it, over. Evangeline: That son of a bitch takes me off the case, and then he buries this lead? Liz: Question is, why is Hank fuckin\\u2019 around\\u2013 Evangeline: Don\\u2019t \\u201cAsk the question\\u201d me! Okay? I\\u2019ll tell you why he did it right now. It\\u2019s the fucking mine behind it. You know I\\u2019m right. Liz: I don\\u2019t know shit. Evangeline: Well, then you\\u2019re a shit detective. Liz: Yeah, well, whatever. Whatever you say. Evangeline: Annie protests against the mine, Annie gets murdered, the police shush it all, do the fucking math. Liz: You do the fuckin\\u2019 math. Evangeline: (sighs) Liz: Alright, without the mine, there\\u2019s no town. 50% of the population works for it, which means half the people who live here have got a reason to silence Annie K. And what about Clark, creepy boyfriend? What, you think the mine\\u2019s responsible for him too? According to your conspiracy theory, Tsalal and Clark had nothin\\u2019 to do with it. Is that it? Evangeline: Not sure yet. Liz: And what about her tongue? Now, what\\u2019s-what\\u2019s your explanation for her tongue poppin\\u2019 up six years after she dies? And what about the men on the ice? Why\\u2019d they go out there? \\u2026 Oh. (scoffs) Come on. Don\\u2019t give me that voodoo, E.T., cosmic choompa-loompa bullshit. Evangeline: (laughs) Are you tryna say \\u201cchupacabra\\u201d? LIz: Whatever, the magic. It\\u2019s no magic. (Evangeline scoffs) Liz: Alright, there\\u2019s a, there\\u2019s a real explanation for this. Evangeline: Alright. I\\u2019m listening. Liz: We\\u2019re just not askin\\u2019 the right questions. We will. We\\u2019ll find it. Evangeline: Who\\u2019s the one that believes in miracles? (phone chimes) Evangeline: Fantasy Football? Liz: No, Tinder. Evangeline: You\\u2019re on Tinder? Liz: Yeah, I\\u2019m on Tinder. Evangeline: Who the fuck is on Tinder in Ennis? Fuckin\\u2019 Old Norman Naki and, ugh, Hank Prior? Liz: No, he\\u2019s taken. (chuckles) Poor bitch. Yeah, I set my Tinder radius for Fairbanks. Ya know, I\\u2019ll take some personal trips. I don\\u2019t fuck where I eat. Evangeline: (snorts) You mean, anymore. Liz: Fuck you. What do you do when you\\u2019re lonely? Evangeline: I watch Netflix. Liz: Come on. For real. What do you do? Evangeline: I pray. Liz: Liz snorts) (laughing) You pray? What do you mean, like, like, get on your knees, \\u201cOur Father, who art in heaven,\\u201d pray? (chuckles) Oh, come on. You kiddin\\u2019 me? You talk to God? Evangeline: No. I listen. Liz: Oh. Evangeline: Don\\u2019t you ever\\u2026 get this feeling, like\\u2013 that sometimes you just wanna (sighs) just disappear? Just walk out\\u2026 never stop? Just go. Just go. (light music playing) (singer vocalizing) (singers vocalizing) Hank: Hey. Peter; Chief Danvers wants you to call\\u2013 Hank: She can wait. Come here for a second. Uh, I was cleanin\\u2019 out the garage and I found these. Yeah, I know, Darwin\\u2019s only four, but, uh, you were already a pretty damn good little skater by that age, so. If ya\\u2026 take him out, shoot me a text, huh? Peter: Yeah, sure. Hank: What\\u2019s Danvers up to? Peter: Uh, she\\u2019s goin\\u2019 through the trailer\\u2019s evidence. Hank: She and Navarro? Peter: Yeah. Hank: I don\\u2019t know what the hell they\\u2019re doin\\u2019 together. I thought they hated each other. Peter: You know what happened there? She won\\u2019t tell me. Hank: No idea. Evangeline: Hey! You received a direct call about Annie K\\u2019s and Raymond Clark\\u2019s relationship. A direct call, and you didn\\u2019t report it? Hank: Danvers, tell your girl here to stand down. Evangeline: You talk to me. Tell me why the fuck you withheld information from a murder investigation? Hank: Oh, please. That woman was sleeping with half of Ennis. What did you want me to do? Log every dude she was banging in the region? Evangeline: You piece of shit. I swear to God, you\\u2019re gonna join your boys over here. Liz: No, no, no. No, no, no. Calm the fuck down. Calm! And you, go back to your fuckin\\u2019 search\\u2026 and get rid of your hillbilly friends. Or you\\u2019re gettin\\u2019 a negligence report for your mishandling of the Kowtok case. Hank: Maybe I oughta file a report on you for playing Mrs. Robinson with my kid. Hm? Liz: You do your fuckin\\u2019 job. Evangeline: That\\u2019s it? \\u201cDo your fucking job\\u201d? That\\u2019s all he gets? Liz: Hey, where you goin\\u2019? Evangeline: Fuck outta here. Peter: Who\\u2019s Mrs. Robinson? Liz: (sighs) Where\\u2019s my forensic tech? Peter: Well, there\\u2019s a blizzard out in North Bay. Visibility\\u2019s shit. No planes are takin\\u2019 off, so they\\u2019re gonna try again tomorrow. Liz: Ah, tomorrow\\u2019s no good. They\\u2019re gonna thaw. And they\\u2019re gettin\\u2019 shipped out to Anchorage. Peter: Well, I have an idea. Liz: What? Peter: I don\\u2019t know if you\\u2019re gonna like it. Liz: Well\\u2026? Peter: My cousin lives in White Lake. He\\u2019s a vet. Works a lot with large animals. Liz: How long before you can get him here? Peter: Well, I can call him right now and see. Liz: Yeah. Peter: Yeah? Liz: Yeah. (tense music playing) (music softens) Evangeline: (shouts) Qavvik! Qavvik: Shh! (wind blowing) Qavvik: Fucker. What can I do for you? Evangeline: (sighs) Do you know Oliver Tagaq? He worked at Tsalal for a bit. Now he might be a hunter, somewhere out on the ice. Qavvik: Tagaq? No. Evangeline: Well, thing is, I know you know someone who knows someone. Homebrew comes with a network. You\\u2019ll ask around? Qavvik: Mm-hmm\\u2026 for a price. Evangeline: You want me to pay you? Qavvik: It\\u2019s called quid pro quo. You tell me something. I tell you something. Evangeline: (scoffs) Don\\u2019t get fuckin\\u2019 cute on me. Qavvik: I\\u2019m not kidding. You tell me something about yourself\\u2026 and I\\u2019ll get you that intel. Evangeline: Fuck you, Qavvik. (door slams) Qavvik: Always lovely to see you, Evangeline. (whistling) Evangeline: (sighing) (door opens, closes) Evangeline: Da fuck you wanna know? Qavvik: Your mom. Tell me about her. Evangeline: Ask Julia. Qavvik: Mm-mm, I\\u2019m asking you. She was local, wasn\\u2019t she? Evangeline: Yeah, from a gold mining camp that\\u2019s gone. She left when she was 15. Met my dad in Boston. Boom. Now get me Tagaq. Qavvik: That\\u2019s that accent, Boston girl. (chuckles) But you didn\\u2019t stay. Evangeline: No. Dad was bad. He drank. He hit her. Us too. So Mom took us and ran. And then we came back up North. Qavvik: Alaska girls always come back. Evangeline: She was\\u2026 not okay. She\\u2013 Qavvik: Like Jules? Evangeline: Yeah. Voices. Episodes. (light, tense music playing) Evangeline: Then one day she ran out and never came back. Qavvik: Was she\\u2013 Evangeline: She was killed. Fucker was never found. Qavvik: (sighs) Oh. Fuck.

I-I think they died before they froze. Liz: What? Vince: I-I mean, they didn\\u2019t freeze to death. I\\u2019ve seen plenty of frozen animals, and cold makes their heart rate drop, their breath grows shallow. They basically fall asleep. All told, a pretty peaceful death. Those guys, this\\u2026 this is not how you die in the cold. It\\u2019s just not. Liz: What killed \\u2019em? Vince: It\\u2019s hard to tell without a chance to properly postmortem them, but looks like cardiac arrest if I had to put money on it. Liz: Oh, well, how can you be sure? Vince: I can\\u2019t. I\\u2019m just a vet, ma\\u2019am. But I\\u2019ve seen caribous die of plain fright. Running, terrified. Uh, these scientists, they, they, uh, they look the same.

[Door slams shut] [Crickets chirping] [Gasping] [Ominous music] [Heavy breathing] [Distant clunks] [Radio playing in background] [Speaking French] Someone slept late? How did your meeting at the bank go? In order to get a loan, I would need to have almost as much as I want to borrow. [Speaking French] Why don\\u2019t you ask Sam? [Speaking French] Don\\u2019t start. [Speaking French] You wore the necklace. [Speaking French] Fuck luck. Always. [Speaking French] Or forget the bank and sell it? [Speaking French] When Gabrielle gave this to me, she said \\u201cGive rubies away, but not your precious heart.\\u201d [Speaking French] Wait. Leave it on. [Speaking French] What happened to us? [Speaking French] I don\\u2019t know. The war? [Speaking French] The easy answer. [Speaking French] Maybe you could pretend that I am someone else. Teresa? [Knocking] [Ominous music] Have you seen Teresa? [Speaking French] This morning? No. Is she not in the bedroom? No. [Speaking French] Well, she couldn\\u2019t have gone far. Not on foot. She could have. If she left last night. Or if someone came and took her. [Slow string music] [Engine revving] [Breaks squealing] Cheeky little automobile, Mr. Spade. Out to enjoy some of that fresh country air, are we? Something like that. Ah, both you and the girl. You saw her? Yes. At dawn, I was on my way here. The colors at sunrise are a painter\\u2019s dream. She was on the road? She came past me. Her shoes were muddy. As if she\\u2019d been running. And her eyes, they were downcast. Seemingly upset. What color were they? I think they were\\u2026 Ah, yes. Sorry, a bit obsessed with details. Occupational hazard, I\\u2019m afraid. Yeah, you said she was upset? Yes, well, I imagine the massacre at the manor was the cause. Oh, you heard about that, huh? Everyone\\u2019s heard about that. From the girl? No, I waved. Tried to chat with her, but she just ignored me. Can\\u2019t say I blame her. Pardon? [Engine revving] [Intense orchestra music] [Distant dog barking] [Car door slams shut] Teresa? [Mysterious piano music] [Water sloshing] [Scrubbing floor] You\\u2019re asking the wrong guy. In my experience, the better souls never stand a chance. [Ominous music] [Ominous music intensifies] [Bell tolls] [Bell tolls louder] [Sam coughing] [Slow string music] [Chain rattling] [String music intensifies] These things will kill you. These are the same ones doctors smoke. I saw on TV. [Coughing] Yeah, you really seem to be enjoying them. Yeah, all right, climb down before you make yourself dizzy and break your neck. I\\u2019m not leaving. Philippe\\u2019s not coming. He promised. I\\u2019m sure he did. Did you do this? No. You know who did? How could I? We\\u2019re not allowed up here. And yet, here you are. They\\u2019re all dead. What difference did their useless rules make? I\\u2019ll tell you what. You stay and wait for your father to show up, smoke to your lungs\\u2019 content. I\\u2019ll be back at sundown. If you\\u2019re still hanging around, you come home with me. If not, then swell knowing you and I hope you and Philippe have a nice life on the run. [Barn door opening] Shit! [Engine revving] Any idea how she ended up inside the chapel last night? I don\\u2019t play with dolls anymore. So, no idea how she lost her head? I gave her away years ago. You know this car still smells like roses. She\\u2019d bring treats to the orphanage at Christmas. Gabrielle. Oranges from California. Imagine that. Sometimes she\\u2019d bring me books or a blouse, or some other piece of clothing she was done with. The books were all in French. She said that once I started to dream in French, I\\u2019d be fluent. She said the same to me. Sadly for everyone, I still dream in English. Though usually French wins. She didn\\u2019t want me to hate you, for what you did to my father. [Gunshot] Get down. [Tires screeches] [Intense music] [Engine revving] Stay down. [Gunshot] [Tires squeal] You all right? [Motorcycle revving] [Engine revving] [Intense string music] [Motorcycle revs in distance] Mr. Spade? Nasty business. This car\\u2019s cursed. Not the person who shot that window, that\\u2019s for sure. Are you saying they missed on purpose? The car was moving too slowly for the gunman not to have hit me. And what about the second shot? Self-defense. I was about to run him over. Yes, of course you were. I\\u2019m not even sure it was meant for me. George: Ah! Lovely. That\\u2019s great. That\\u2019s my new neighbor. An odd fellow. [Sighs] Philippe could have taken the shot. With Teresa in the car? Hard to imagine even Philippe doing that. And he\\u2019s wounded, which shouldn\\u2019t make him too hard to find for a pair of top detectives like you and\\u2026 [In French] your idiot brother. Samuel, we talked about you using words like \\u201cmoron\\u201d and \\u201cidiot\\u201d when speaking to my brother. Terms of endearment. We\\u2019ve checked the two hospitals in the area. No one with a bullet wound has been admitted. Same goes for veterinarians and dentists. Sounds like you two are right on top of things. [Footsteps] Mr. Spade, can I borrow your lawyer? You were four years old. [Pencil scrawling on paper] [Bike chain winding] Henri: I took her to Le Canard Noir, that old place in Rodez. Set me back 20 francs. I\\u2019ll take care of that. Best 20 francs I ever spent. With that stupid grin, I\\u2019ll assume that you and Mademoiselle Ruse are once again exchanging\\u2026 [In French] the heat of passion. In the General\\u2019s office. On his desk. I hope one of you didn\\u2019t wrinkle Philippe\\u2019s file. Sergeant Saint-Andre\\u2019s file is rather short. On several pages, names, dates, places are blacked out. He\\u2019s army intelligence. I\\u2019m sorry, I couldn\\u2019t get more. That\\u2019s plenty. Philippe, a spy. I guess the war really did deplete the supply of able men. There was something I heard, just a rumor. Well, there\\u2019s this bow near the base, where a lot of ex-Deuxi\\u00e8me Bureau guys hang out. Every so often, I go there for a drink, and the other night, there was some joking about Saint-Andre hiding a young woman in his quarters his last time on base. He\\u2019s probably not the first. The woman was Algerian. No one heard her name. Thank you, Henri. Much appreciated. Any time. I must confess, since I was a child, you\\u2019ve been my hero. Your hero? Oui. My advice, trade up. [Water splashes] [Ominous music] [People talking in the distance] [Romantic Latin music] Woman: You know what they say, \\u201cMarry for money, divorce for love.\\u201d I thought it was, \\u201cmarry for money, earn every nickel.\\u201d Which do you believe? I\\u2019ll get back to you. You forget something, sweetheart? We\\u2019re having a swim, aren\\u2019t we? What will the gardener think? I\\u2019m not worried about the gardener leaving me for someone younger. If I were you, I\\u2019d be more worried about mosquito bites. I\\u2019m not going anywhere. I\\u2019m just reminding you, there\\u2019s more to me than my money. How could I ever forget? [Water splashes] Doctor: Why must the innocent always pay for the rest of us, for our sins? When the Nazis paid their little visit, mother superior ran guns for the underground. Your point? No one\\u2019s innocent. Still, one tries to be on the right side of things. If only one knew what that was. Six dead nuns, five files. Which one is missing? I know these women. I examined them every six months. Three were from Spain, one was from Portugal, and the mother superior was born here. The last was an African. We had not yet met. There\\u2019s no file for her. I met that one briefly. [Coughs] Can I see the bodies? Patrice had them all bagged for transport to Paris. Does Patrice really want Paris crawling up and down his town? He does not, but he understands that six massacred nuns, or dead nuns in any number, bring much unwanted pressure. And Paris is better equipped. The extent of the autopsies I can do run from death from fall off ladder to death from heart attack. Don\\u2019t forget boredom. You joke, but the ministry was quite serious and quite clear in their instruction. I was not to touch the bodies. Of course, they said that after I found this around the neck of the African. [Bell rings] [Envelope rustles] I didn\\u2019t know nuns were allowed to wear jewelry. [Locket clicks] Real nuns, that is. [Suspenseful orchestral music] [Discordant music] [Laughing] [Clock ticking] [Suspenseful piano and orchestral music] [Footsteps approaching] [Door opens] [Gun clatters] [Gun clatters] -[Door thuds and squeaks] [Door slams] We must wait for the replacement windows to come from England. How long? [Dog barking] Who shot you? Technically, I was shot at. Just a second. I care about this car, so whatever your feelings for the late Jacques Laveront, promise me you\\u2019ll take good care of her. I\\u2019ll treat the car as I would any beautiful woman I despise, with respect in her presence and lust in her absence. Good, then we understand each other. I think. Ciao, Anatole.Sam. Just happened to be passing by? No one has been shot or shot at here for a long time. Not since the war. And that was collaborators killing partisans and partisans killing collaborators, not some crazy person executing nuns. There\\u2019s been another war since, in case you\\u2019ve forgotten. And we both know that one\\u2019s made plenty of people crazy and desperate. This is not really about people though. This is about you. There are six dead women who might say otherwise. That was yesterday. Today someone shot at you. But you\\u2019re not worried about me. Could Jean-Pierre have done this? Sure, he could have, but he didn\\u2019t. How do you know? He\\u2019s all talk. But murder, no. Jean-Pierre would disagree. So would every man who went to war. That\\u2019s why they give them medals, with snappy uniforms to pin them on. That way, whenever they look in a mirror, they see a soldier. And what about the man who burns his uniform and sells his medals? What does he see? You may think you understand him, but you make him feel small. You make most men feel small. That\\u2019s because they don\\u2019t know me. Then, I\\u2019ve never much cared what other men thought of me. Not caring doesn\\u2019t make one bulletproof. You should needle point that one on a pillow. Sometimes, Sam\\u2026 [Birds chirping] [Cuckoo cooing] Spade, I\\u2019d like you to meet my mother. Lady Cynthia, Sam Spade. How do you do, Mr. Spade? I\\u2019ve been better. I\\u2019m so sorry for invading your devastatingly attractive home without being asked, but George said he\\u2026 he didn\\u2019t think you\\u2019d mind. I don\\u2019t. Nice to meet you. Oh, Mr. Spade. Um, please feel free to say no, but may I ask you an enormous favor? Sure, you can ask. I\\u2019ve never seen the landscape my husband painted for your late wife. Um, would you mind, terribly, if I came inside with you and took a peek? May I come, too? I\\u2026 I haven\\u2019t laid eyes on that painting since the day of the unveiling. More the merrier. Ah. Ah. George and I have rented the villa next door. Uh, we\\u2019re neighbors. Though, of course, it\\u2019s hardly as scrumptious as all this. Gabrielle\\u2019s family got the house on the cheap. The previous owner died suddenly. Oh. He was guillotined. [Cynthia gasps] In fact, he got his head chopped off right after Marie Antoinette. Oh, dear. Mother, he\\u2019s pulling your leg. Oh, capital. [Laughing] Oh, you\\u2019ll find I\\u2019m extremely gullible, Mr. Spade. Somehow, I doubt that. [Door opens] Oh, thank you. George, look at this marvelous place. Oh, they don\\u2019t make them like this anymore, do they? Ooh, oh, oh. [George and Cynthia sighing and laughing] It\\u2019s just wonderful! Yes, Mother, notice the shadowing. Ah. Ah. Singeon\\u2019s sense of color was always divine. And look, George, look how he\\u2019s captured the\\u2026 the delicate flesh tones of this lovely, naked lady. Well, I\\u2019ll leave you two to show yourselves out. Yes, thank you so much. Awfully kind of you. [clock chimes] Oh, one more thing. I believe we have a mutual friend, Philippe Saint-Andre. I wouldn\\u2019t say that Philippe and I are friends, more like, a long time ago, we bumped into each other. Oh, oh, I\\u2026 I\\u2026 I\\u2026 I see. Well, I\\u2026 I hear he\\u2019s returned to Bazuel. I would love to say hello. I\\u2019m afraid I can\\u2019t help you. I\\u2019ve no idea where he is. Mm, pity. How do you know Philippe? Well, uh, years ago, he purchased one of my husband\\u2019s masterpieces. Really? Mm. He paid a generous sum for it, too. Are you sure we\\u2019re talking about the same Philippe Saint-Andre? The Philippe I know isn\\u2019t one to part with a generous sum, or any kind of sum, for anything that he could just as easily take. [Radio announcer speaking French] [Item thuds] No. [Footsteps retreating] [Birds chirping] Well, this morning, I had to get a ride from Basem to buy two new tires. You had to slash the spare, too? I don\\u2019t know what you\\u2019re talking about. You sound like your mother. That was her favorite answer to every question. \\u201cI don\\u2019t know what you\\u2019re talking about.\\u201d It was like a tick. [Coughs] And that\\u2019s what you get for saying such things about my mother. [Sam coughing] Are you all right? Are you sick? Couldn\\u2019t be better. Just tell me where you saw this glint. Yeah, no one\\u2019s gonna take a shot from there. What\\u2019s that? Is that a clue? Right now, it\\u2019s just an empty pack of cigarettes. Well, they haven\\u2019t been here very long. Really? Yeah, it was windy last night, so if the pack was here before, it would\\u2019ve been covered in leaves. Interesting theory. Okay, tell me what you saw in the chapel. I\\u2019m really hungry. Teresa. Helena said she\\u2019s making me ravioli. What did you see in the chapel? I told you. That monk fellow hit the mother superior and then we all ran away. Yeah, you said that before, and you were very convincing, but someone locked the kids in the closet, and this morning, someone took a shot at you. At me? To scare you, to keep you from talking, which means you either saw something you shouldn\\u2019t have seen or you know something you shouldn\\u2019t know. Why did Philippe come running to you? I\\u2019m his daughter. You\\u2019re his daughter, yet he didn\\u2019t feel the need to fill you in on who shot him and why? He was protecting me from knowing things I shouldn\\u2019t. Protecting you how? By then, just leaving you alone? [Birds chirping] My father didn\\u2019t come to see me. He was there to meet someone else, one of the sisters. Which one? The new one, soeur Angelique. Then his plans changed when he got shot. [Locket clatters] Yeah, that\\u2019s them. \\u201cThem\\u201d? What, the kid was with her? No, he came a month later with Papa. So, Philippe shows up wounded, with a kid, and tells you what? To hide the boy while he found a place to stay and got patched up. He said he\\u2019d come back for us in a day. He leaves the kid with you, takes off, and the monk comes knocking. [Birds chirping] I was hiding Zahid in the tower when I heard the kids screaming. [Children screaming] They were running from the chapel. They said a priest hit\\u2026 [In French] mother superior. So, you didn\\u2019t actually see him hit her like you\\u2019ve been saying? No. Then what? You locked the kids in the closet? To keep them safe. [Door slams] [Key rattles] Shh, shh! I ran back to my room. And heard the first gunshot. [Gun fires] [Monk speaking in French] The monk was shouting. [Monk and nuns whispering in French] He was telling soeur Angelique that she had to watch while he asked each of them where the boy was. [Gun clicks] [Monk speaking in French] And when they wouldn\\u2019t say\\u2026 [Gun fires] he shot them\\u2026 one by one. [Nuns whispering in French] [Gun clicks] [Monk talking in French language] [Nun screams] [Gun fires] [Teresa panting] [Nun moans] [Gun fires] [Gun clicking] [Nun screams] [Gun fires] [Nun screams] [Gun fires] I tried to close my eyes, but I couldn\\u2019t look away. And then\\u2026 Then what? He saw me. [Gasping] [Thuds] [Teresa panting] [Monk grunts] [Knife scrapes] So, you told him where the boy was? No. You weren\\u2019t afraid? I had my knife. Well, sadly, I lost it. In the chapel? In the monk. [Knife stabs] [Monk screams] [Squelches] [Footsteps thudding] [Door slams] I ran to the bell tower, but the boy was gone. Who is this kid that someone would kill six people to find him? I don\\u2019t know. But right before he killed her\\u2026 Soeur Angelique said something. The Mahdi? What the hell has your father gotten you into? [Suspenseful orchestral music] [Suspenseful orchestral music continues] [Wood clatters] [Suspenseful orchestral music intensifies] \\u266a \\u266a \\u266a\\u266aLet\\u2019s play a game, you and I, called \\u201cI won\\u2019t lie to Sam.\\u201d \\u266a We got a meeting with the bishop. Want to come along? As long as no one asks me to confess. Mr. Spade, do you have any specific information you want to share? I just did. I need to find Philippe. [Chuckles] If I want you dead, I just have to wait. [Telephone rings] You want to have a real conversation, knock on my door. \\u266a \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Your email address will not be published.

aircrewmen boys who have yet to experience combat their lives depend on order and discipline and your example yes sir  with all due respect i think i would be of more use to them and you as a squadron commander rather than an air exec just because you spin the baton at the front doesnt make you the band leader i just dont think i was made to sit behind a desk i need to be up there helping my guys

title na\\noriginal release date january   after a horrific murder shocks a small town retired detective spade takes the case secretive teresa has clues but wont share spade digs deeper unaware the killer may target him next       what monster doctor lets go  terribly sad outside of the antique i barely got you for st valentines or whatever do you still possess a working pistol anyone who wants to shoot me will have to bring their own gun i have no idea what that means but it has the ring of your usual moral foolishness still theres a madman running around you might want to protect yourself with something more reliable than just your wits       is it true the sisters all of them  wheres teresa  i prepared the blue room for her let the poor thing sleep whatever you need from her will wait         someone slept late how did your meeting at the bank go in order to get a loan i would need to have almost as much as i want to borrow  why dont you ask sam  dont start  you wore the necklace  fuck luck always  or forget the bank and sell it  when gabrielle gave this to me she said give rubies away but not your precious heart  wait leave it on  what happened to us  i dont know the war  the easy answer  maybe you could pretend that i am someone else teresa   have you seen teresa  this morning no is she not in the bedroom no  well she couldnt have gone far not on foot she could have if she left last night or if someone came and took her    cheeky little automobile mr spade out to enjoy some of that fresh country air are we something like that ah both you and the girl you saw her yes at dawn i was on my way here the colors at sunrise are a painters dream she was on the road she came past me her shoes were muddy as if shed been running and her eyes they were downcast seemingly upset what color were they i think they were ah yes sorry a bit obsessed with details occupational hazard im afraid yeah you said she was upset yes well i imagine the massacre at the manor was the cause oh you heard about that huh everyones heard about that from the girl no i waved tried to chat with her but she just ignored me cant say i blame her pardon     teresa    youre asking the wrong guy in my experience the better souls never stand a chance         these things will kill you these are the same ones doctors smoke i saw on tv  yeah you really seem to be enjoying them yeah all right climb down before you make yourself dizzy and break your neck im not leaving philippes not coming he promised im sure he did did you do this no you know who did how could i were not allowed up here and yet here you are theyre all dead what difference did their useless rules make ill tell you what you stay and wait for your father to show up smoke to your lungs content ill be back at sundown if youre still hanging around you come home with me if not then swell knowing you and i hope you and philippe have a nice life on the run  shit  any idea how she ended up inside the chapel last night i dont play with dolls anymore so no idea how she lost her head i gave her away years ago you know this car still smells like roses shed bring treats to the orphanage at christmas gabrielle oranges from california imagine that sometimes shed bring me books or a blouse or some other piece of clothing she was done with the books were all in french she said that once i started to dream in french id be fluent she said the same to me sadly for everyone i still dream in english though usually french wins she didnt want me to hate you for what you did to my father  get down    stay down   you all right     mr spade nasty business this cars cursed not the person who shot that window thats for sure are you saying they missed on purpose the car was moving too slowly for the gunman not to have hit me and what about the second shot selfdefense i was about to run him over yes of course you were im not even sure it was meant for me george ah lovely thats great thats my new neighbor an odd fellow  philippe could have taken the shot with teresa in the car hard to imagine even philippe doing that and hes wounded which shouldnt make him too hard to find for a pair of top detectives like you and  your idiot brother samuel we talked about you using words like moron and idiot when speaking to my brother terms of endearment weve checked the two hospitals in the area no one with a bullet wound has been admitted same goes for veterinarians and dentists sounds like you two are right on top of things  mr spade can i borrow your lawyer you were four years old   henri i took her to le canard noir that old place in rodez set me back  francs ill take care of that best  francs i ever spent with that stupid grin ill assume that you and mademoiselle ruse are once again exchanging  the heat of passion in the generals office on his desk i hope one of you didnt wrinkle philippes file sergeant saintandres file is rather short on several pages names dates places are blacked out hes army intelligence im sorry i couldnt get more thats plenty philippe a spy i guess the war really did deplete the supply of able men there was something i heard just a rumor well theres this bow near the base where a lot of exdeuxi\\u00e8me bureau guys hang out every so often i go there for a drink and the other night there was some joking about saintandre hiding a young woman in his quarters his last time on base hes probably not the first the woman was algerian no one heard her name thank you henri much appreciated any time i must confess since i was a child youve been my hero your hero oui my advice trade up     woman you know what they say marry for money divorce for love i thought it was marry for money earn every nickel which do you believe ill get back to you you forget something sweetheart were having a swim arent we what will the gardener think im not worried about the gardener leaving me for someone younger if i were you id be more worried about mosquito bites im not going anywhere im just reminding you theres more to me than my money how could i ever forget  doctor why must the innocent always pay for the rest of us for our sins when the nazis paid their little visit mother superior ran guns for the underground your point no ones innocent still one tries to be on the right side of things if only one knew what that was six dead nuns five files which one is missing i know these women i examined them every six months three were from spain one was from portugal and the mother superior was born here the last was an african we had not yet met theres no file for her i met that one briefly  can i see the bodies patrice had them all bagged for transport to paris does patrice really want paris crawling up and down his town he does not but he understands that six massacred nuns or dead nuns in any number bring much unwanted pressure and paris is better equipped the extent of the autopsies i can do run from death from fall off ladder to death from heart attack dont forget boredom you joke but the ministry was quite serious and quite clear in their instruction i was not to touch the bodies of course they said that after i found this around the neck of the african   i didnt know nuns were allowed to wear jewelry  real nuns that is            we must wait for the replacement windows to come from england how long  who shot you technically i was shot at just a second i care about this car so whatever your feelings for the late jacques laveront promise me youll take good care of her ill treat the car as i would any beautiful woman i despise with respect in her presence and lust in her absence good then we understand each other i think ciao anatolesam just happened to be passing by no one has been shot or shot at here for a long time not since the war and that was collaborators killing partisans and partisans killing collaborators not some crazy person executing nuns theres been another war since in case youve forgotten and we both know that ones made plenty of people crazy and desperate this is not really about people though this is about you there are six dead women who might say otherwise that was yesterday today someone shot at you but youre not worried about me could jeanpierre have done this sure he could have but he didnt how do you know hes all talk but murder no jeanpierre would disagree so would every man who went to war thats why they give them medals with snappy uniforms to pin them on that way whenever they look in a mirror they see a soldier and what about the man who burns his uniform and sells his medals what does he see you may think you understand him but you make him feel small you make most men feel small thats because they dont know me then ive never much cared what other men thought of me not caring doesnt make one bulletproof you should needle point that one on a pillow sometimes sam   spade id like you to meet my mother lady cynthia sam spade how do you do mr spade ive been better im so sorry for invading your devastatingly attractive home without being asked but george said he he didnt think youd mind i dont nice to meet you oh mr spade um please feel free to say no but may i ask you an enormous favor sure you can ask ive never seen the landscape my husband painted for your late wife um would you mind terribly if i came inside with you and took a peek may i come too i i havent laid eyes on that painting since the day of the unveiling more the merrier ah ah george and i have rented the villa next door uh were neighbors though of course its hardly as scrumptious as all this gabrielles family got the house on the cheap the previous owner died suddenly oh he was guillotined  in fact he got his head chopped off right after marie antoinette oh dear mother hes pulling your leg oh capital  oh youll find im extremely gullible mr spade somehow i doubt that  oh thank you george look at this marvelous place oh they dont make them like this anymore do they ooh oh oh  its just

slash the spare too i dont know what youre talking about you sound like your mother that was her favorite answer to every question i dont know what youre talking about it was like a tick  and thats what you get for saying such things about my mother  are you all right are you sick couldnt be better just tell me where you saw this glint yeah no ones gonna take a shot from there whats that is that a clue right now its just an empty pack of cigarettes well they havent been here very long really yeah it was windy last night so if the pack was here before it wouldve been covered in leaves interesting theory okay tell me what you saw in the chapel im really hungry teresa helena said shes making me ravioli what did you see in the chapel i told you that monk fellow hit the mother superior and then we all ran away yeah you said that before and you were very convincing but someone locked the kids in the closet and this morning someone took a shot at you at me to scare you to keep you from talking which means you either saw something you shouldnt have seen or you know something you shouldnt know why did philippe come running to you im his daughter youre his daughter yet he didnt feel the need to fill you in on who shot him and why he was protecting me from knowing things i shouldnt protecting you how by then just leaving you alone  my father didnt come to see me he was there to meet someone else one of the sisters which one the new one soeur angelique then his plans changed when he got shot  yeah thats them them what the kid was with her no he came a month later with papa so philippe shows up wounded with a kid and tells you what to hide the boy while he found a place to stay and got patched up he said hed come back for us in a day he leaves the kid with you takes off and the monk comes knocking  i was hiding zahid in the tower when i heard the kids screaming  they were running from the chapel they said a priest hit  mother superior so you didnt actually see him hit her like youve been saying no then what you locked the kids in the closet to keep them safe   shh shh i ran back to my room and heard the first gunshot   the monk was shouting  he was telling soeur angelique that she had to watch while he asked each of them where the boy was   and when they wouldnt say  he shot them one by one              i tried to close my eyes but i couldnt look away and then then what he saw me      so you told him where the boy was no you werent afraid i had my knife well sadly i lost it in the chapel in the monk      i ran to the bell tower but the boy was gone who is this kid that someone would kill six people to find him i dont know but right before he killed her soeur angelique said something the mahdi what the hell has your father gotten you into       lets play a game you and i called i wont lie to sam  we got a meeting with the bishop want to come along as long as no one asks me to confess mr spade do you have any specific information you want to

aircrewmen boys who have yet to experience combat their lives depend on order and discipline and your example yes sir  with all due respect i think i would be of more use to them and you as a squadron

murder shocks a small town retired detective spade takes the case secretive teresa has clues but wont share spade digs deeper unaware the killer may target him next       what monster doctor lets go  terribly sad outside of the antique i barely got you for st valentines or whatever do you still possess a working pistol anyone who wants to shoot me will have to bring their own gun i have no idea what that means but it has the ring of your usual moral foolishness still theres a madman running around you might want to protect yourself with something more reliable than just your wits       is it true the sisters all of them  wheres teresa  i prepared the blue room for her let the poor thing sleep whatever you need from her will wait         someone slept late how did your meeting at the bank go in order to get a loan i would need to have almost as much as i want to borrow  why dont you ask sam  dont start  you wore the necklace  fuck luck always  or forget the bank and sell it  when gabrielle gave this to me she said give rubies away but not your precious heart  wait leave it on  what happened to us  i dont know the war  the easy answer  maybe you could pretend that i am someone else teresa   have you seen teresa  this morning no is she not in the bedroom no  well she couldnt have gone far not on foot she could have if she left last night or if someone came and took her    cheeky little automobile mr spade out to enjoy some of that fresh country air are we something like that ah both you and the girl you saw her yes at dawn i was on my way here the colors at sunrise are a painters dream she was on the road she came past me her shoes were muddy as if shed been running and her eyes they were downcast seemingly upset what color were they i think they were ah yes sorry a bit obsessed with details occupational hazard im afraid yeah you said she was upset yes well i imagine the massacre at the manor was the cause oh you heard about that huh everyones heard about that from the girl no i waved tried to chat with her but she just ignored me cant say i blame her pardon     teresa    youre asking the wrong guy in my experience the better souls never stand a chance         these things will kill you these are the same ones doctors smoke i saw on tv  yeah you really seem to be enjoying them yeah all right climb down before you make yourself dizzy and break your neck im not leaving philippes not coming he promised im sure he did did you do this no you know who did how could i were not allowed up here and yet here you are theyre all dead what difference did their useless rules make ill tell you what you stay and wait for your father to show up smoke to your lungs content ill be back at sundown if youre still hanging around you come home with me if not then swell knowing you and i hope you and philippe have a nice life on the run  shit  any idea how she ended up inside the chapel last night i dont play with dolls anymore so no idea how she lost her head i gave her away years ago you know this car still smells like roses shed bring treats to the orphanage at christmas gabrielle oranges from california imagine that sometimes shed bring me books or a blouse or some other piece of clothing she was done with the books were all in french she said that once i started to dream in french id be fluent she said the same to me sadly for everyone i still dream in english though usually french wins she didnt want me to hate you for what you did to my father  get down    stay down   you all right     mr spade nasty business this cars cursed not the person who shot that window thats for sure are you saying they missed on purpose the car was moving too slowly for the gunman not to have hit me and what about the second shot selfdefense i was about to run him over yes of course you were im not even sure it was meant for me george ah lovely thats great thats my new neighbor an odd fellow  philippe could have taken the shot with teresa in the car hard to imagine even philippe doing that and hes wounded which shouldnt make him too hard to find for a pair of top detectives like you and  your idiot brother samuel we talked about you using words like moron and idiot when speaking to my brother terms of endearment weve checked the two hospitals in the area no one with a bullet wound has been admitted same goes for veterinarians and dentists sounds like you two are right on top of things  mr spade can i borrow your lawyer you were four years old   henri i took her to le canard noir that old place in rodez set me back  francs ill take care of that best  francs i ever spent with that stupid grin ill assume that you and mademoiselle ruse are once again exchanging  the heat of passion in the generals office on his desk i hope one of you didnt wrinkle philippes file sergeant saintandres file is rather short on several pages names dates places are blacked out hes army intelligence im sorry i couldnt get more thats plenty philippe a spy i guess the war really did deplete the supply of able men there was something i heard just a rumor well theres this bow near the base where a lot of exdeuxi\\u00e8me bureau guys hang out every so often i go there for a drink and the other night there was some joking about saintandre hiding a young woman in his quarters his last time on base hes probably not the first the woman was algerian no one heard her name thank you henri much appreciated any time i must confess since i was a child youve been my hero your hero oui my advice trade up     woman you know what they say marry for money divorce for love i thought it was marry for money earn every nickel which do you believe ill get back to you you forget something sweetheart were having a swim arent we what will the gardener think im not worried about the gardener leaving me for someone younger if i were you id be more worried about mosquito bites im not going anywhere im just reminding you theres more to me than my money how could i ever forget  doctor why must the innocent always pay for the rest of us for our sins when the nazis paid their little visit mother superior ran guns for the underground your point no ones innocent still one tries to be on the right side of things if only one knew what that was six dead nuns five files which one is missing i know these women i examined them every six months three were from spain one was from portugal and the mother superior was born here the last was an african we had not yet met theres no file for her i met that one briefly  can i see the bodies patrice had them all bagged for transport to paris does patrice really want paris crawling up and down his town he does not but he understands that six massacred nuns or dead nuns in any number bring much unwanted pressure and paris is better equipped the extent of the autopsies i can do run from death from fall off ladder to death from heart attack dont forget boredom you joke but the ministry was quite serious and quite clear in their instruction i was not to touch the bodies of course they said that after i found this around the neck of the african   i didnt know nuns were allowed to wear jewelry  real nuns that is            we must wait for the replacement windows to come from england how long  who shot you technically i was shot at just a second i care about this car so whatever your feelings for the late jacques laveront promise me youll take good care of her ill treat the car as i would any beautiful woman i despise with respect in her presence and lust in her absence good then we understand each other i think ciao anatolesam just happened to be passing by no one has been shot or shot at here for a long time not since the war and that was collaborators killing partisans and partisans killing collaborators not some crazy person executing nuns theres been another war since in case youve forgotten and we both know that ones made plenty of people crazy and desperate this is not really about people though this is about you there are six dead women who might say otherwise that was yesterday today someone shot at you but youre not worried about me could jeanpierre have done this sure he could have but he didnt how do you know hes all talk but murder no jeanpierre would disagree so would every man who went to war thats why they give them medals with snappy uniforms to pin them on that way whenever they look in a mirror they see a soldier and what about the man who burns his uniform and sells his medals what does he see you may think you understand him but you make him feel small you make most men feel small thats because they dont know me then ive never much cared what other men thought of me not caring doesnt make one bulletproof you should needle point that one on a pillow sometimes sam   spade id like you to meet my mother lady cynthia sam spade how do you do mr spade ive been better im so sorry for invading your devastatingly attractive home without being asked but george said he he didnt think youd mind i dont nice to meet you oh mr spade um please feel free to say no but may i ask you an enormous favor sure you can ask ive never seen the landscape my husband painted for your late wife um would you mind terribly if i came inside with you and took a peek may i come too i i havent laid eyes on that painting since the day of the unveiling more the merrier ah ah george and i have rented the villa next door uh were neighbors though of course its hardly as scrumptious as all this gabrielles family got the house on the cheap the previous owner died suddenly oh he was guillotined  in fact he got his head chopped off right after marie antoinette oh dear mother hes pulling your leg oh capital  oh youll find im extremely gullible mr spade somehow i doubt that  oh thank you george look at this marvelous place oh they dont make them like this anymore do they ooh oh oh  its just wonderful yes mother notice the shadowing ah ah singeons sense of color was always divine and look george look how hes captured the the delicate flesh tones of this lovely naked lady well ill leave you two to show yourselves out yes thank you so much awfully kind of you  oh one more thing i believe we have a mutual friend philippe saintandre i wouldnt say that philippe and i are friends more like a long time ago we bumped into each other oh oh i i i i see well i i hear hes returned to bazuel i would love to say hello im afraid i cant help you ive no idea where he is mm pity how do you know philippe well uh years ago he purchased one of my husbands masterpieces really mm he paid a generous sum for it too are you sure were talking about the same philippe saintandre the philippe i know isnt one to part with a generous sum or any kind of sum for anything that he could just as easily take   no   well this morning i had to get a ride from basem to buy two new tires you had to slash the spare too i dont know what youre talking about you sound like your mother that was her favorite answer to every question i dont know what youre talking about it was like a tick  and thats what you get for saying such things about my mother  are you all right are you sick couldnt be better just tell me where you saw this glint yeah no ones gonna take a shot from there whats that is that a clue right now its just an empty pack of cigarettes well they havent been here very long really yeah it was windy last night so if the pack was here before it wouldve been covered in leaves interesting theory okay tell me what you saw in the chapel im really hungry teresa helena said shes making me ravioli what did you see in the chapel i told you that monk fellow hit the mother superior and then we all ran away yeah you said that before and you were very convincing but someone locked the kids in the closet and this morning someone took a shot at you at me to scare you to keep you from talking which means you either saw something you shouldnt have seen or you know something you shouldnt know why did philippe come running to you im his daughter youre his daughter yet he didnt feel the need to fill you in on who shot him and why he was protecting me from knowing things i shouldnt protecting you how by then just leaving you alone  my father didnt come to see me he was there to meet someone else one of the sisters which one the new one soeur angelique then his plans changed when he got shot  yeah thats them them what the kid was with her no he came a month later with papa so philippe shows up wounded with a kid and tells you what to hide the boy while he found a place to stay and got patched up he said hed come back for us in a day he leaves the kid with you takes off and the monk comes knocking  i was hiding zahid in the tower when i heard the kids screaming  they were running from the chapel they said a priest hit  mother superior so you didnt actually see him hit her like youve been saying no then what you locked the kids in the closet to keep them safe   shh shh i ran back to my room and heard the first gunshot   the monk was shouting  he was telling soeur angelique that she had to watch while he asked each of them where the boy was   and when they wouldnt say  he shot them one by one              i tried to close my eyes but i couldnt look away and then then what he saw me      so you told him where the boy was no you werent afraid i had my knife well sadly i lost it in the chapel in the monk      i ran to the bell tower but the boy was gone who is this kid that someone would kill six people to find him i dont know but right before he killed her soeur angelique said something the mahdi what the hell has your father gotten you into       lets play a game you and i called i wont lie to sam  we got a meeting with the bishop want to come along as long as no one asks me to confess mr spade do you have any specific information you want to share i just did i need to find philippe  if i want you dead i just have to

Crafted by the creative duo John Shiban and John Orloff, and further developed by Orloff for Apple TV+, this series marks a significant addition to the platform\\u2019s offerings. The narrative is rooted in Donald L. Miller\\u2019s 2007 book, \\u201cMasters of the Air: America\\u2019s Bomber Boys Who Fought the Air War Against Nazi Germany.\\u201d It vividly recounts the harrowing experiences of the 100th Bomb Group, a B-17 Flying Fortress squadron in the Eighth Air Force during World War II. Known infamously as the \\u201cBloody Hundredth,\\u201d this group was distinguished by the severe casualties it suffered in the thick of battle. \\u201cMasters of the Air\\u201d stands as a companion piece to the esteemed series \\u201cBand of Brothers\\u201d (2001) and \\u201cThe Pacific\\u201d (2010), completing a trilogy of sorts in war-time storytelling. Notably, it is the first series to be produced by Apple Studios, in collaboration with Playtone and Amblin Television, showcasing a significant investment in quality historical drama. The production, which commenced in England in 2021, faced numerous setbacks due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite these challenges, \\u201cMasters of the Air\\u201d successfully premiered on January 26, 2024, demonstrating resilience and commitment to bringing a pivotal era of history to the screen. * * * The premiere episode of \\u201cMasters of the Air\\u201d introduces key members of the 100th Bomb Group during World War II, such as Gale \\u201cBuck\\u201d Cleven and John \\u201cBucky\\u201d Egan. The episode, blending fact with fiction, confirms some historical details, like the B-17 Flying Fortress named \\u201cAlice from Dallas,\\u201d but leaves others, such as Bucky\\u2019s narwhal tusk incident, ambiguous. Key plotlines involve challenging landings, airsickness leading to navigational errors, and the introduction of a dog named Meatball. The episode culminates in the 100th Bomb Group\\u2019s first mission, a disastrous affair resulting in significant losses, mirroring historical events. Personal struggles are also depicted, including a soldier\\u2019s hands freezing to his gun and a colonel\\u2019s unexplained illness, likely drawn from personal anecdotes rather than public records. * * * [captains sigh] [captain 1] Two more. [bartender] Coming right up. Bucky\\u2019s got all the luck. Yeah, she\\u2019s pretty. No, not that. Lucky bastard\\u2019s shipping out tomorrow. He\\u2019s gonna be a stone\\u2019s throw away from the Krauts, while the rest of us will still be flying practice missions over Nebraska. Ah. Don\\u2019t worry. We\\u2019ll be over there dropping bombs soon enough. Yeah. Bucky, next round\\u2019s on us. He\\u2019s never done that before. [chuckles] So you\\u2019re Bucky, and he\\u2019s Buck? Uh, it\\u2019s a long story. They make a nice pair, don\\u2019t they? Oh, I should have introduced them earlier. He\\u2019s leaving tomorrow. Everyone needs someone to write to back home. I don\\u2019t know if John Egan\\u2019s the pen pal type. Hmm. Well, maybe if he met a girl worth writing to, he would be. Ah. Well, a girl worth writing to is hard to find. Not if you know where to look. Ah. I see what you mean. Mm-hmm. Hmm. So, you\\u2019ll write me? Well, I already have. You wrote me a letter? Yeah. What\\u2019s it say? Well, you\\u2019ll have to wait and find out. [chuckles] Well, when will that be? Mmm. When I ship out. I\\u2019d say two or three weeks. I\\u2019m gonna miss you every second. [captain 2] All right, all right. Gentlemen, a toast. Buck, Marge\\u2026 hey, you lovebirds\\u2026 we\\u2019re toasting Bucky over here. [patron 1] Hear, hear, Major Egan. To our new Air Exec, Bucky. [patron 1] Hey, hey. [patron 2] All right, Major. [captain 1] Of all the drunks in the 100th. Well, someone\\u2019s got to make a nest for the rest of you dodos. Cheers, Major. [patron 1] To the 100th. [patron 3] Yeah, to the 100th. [patron 4] Best of luck, sir. [sighs] Thanks. [captain 2] Save some Krauts for us. We\\u2019re going to Slooter\\u2019s. You guys coming? Nah, I-I gotta fly early. [captain 2] Buck? I don\\u2019t think so, boys. See you tomorrow then. Bye, Marge. Bucky, see you in England. And remember, I want extra blankets and a cot with a view. [groans] Consider it done. He won\\u2019t tell me. What\\u2019s with the nicknames? [chuckles] [friend] Spill, Marge. Yeah? Go ahead. Go ahead. Okay. [Bucky] Told you, it\\u2019s a long story. Well, they met in basic training before the war started. John, uh\\u2026 John was always Bucky since he was a kid. Right? That\\u2019s right, yeah. And Gale\\u2026 Well, Gale\\u2019s always been Gale. Until\\u2026 First day of basic training, this fella walks up to me and says that I remind him of a guy back home in, uh, Wisconsin, goes by the name of Buck. I tell him my name\\u2019s Gale, Gale Cleven. [both chuckle] And, uh\\u2026 But Bucky here, he\\u2019s not deterred. No, sir. It\\u2019s, uh\\u2026 It\\u2019s just \\u201cBuck this, Buck that.\\u201d \\u201cBuck, can you help me tie my shoes?\\u201d \\u201cBuck, help me fly this plane.\\u201d [chuckles] Before I know it, the whole damn Eighth Air Force is calling me Buck. So\\u2026 What kind of a name is Gale anyway? Oh. [gasps] [Bucky] You know what? You\\u2026 You know what? You should actually be thanking me. I did you a favor. For giving me the same name as you? It\\u2019s not exactly the same name, and it\\u2019s not my fault you look exactly like Buck from Manitowoc, Wisconsin. From Manitowoc. What kind of man does that to his best friend? Aw, it\\u2019s so sweet. [chuckles] Mmm. We need music. Okay. Don\\u2019t go away, Gale\\u2026 Mmm. Buck. You\\u2019re gonna dance with me before this night is through. Oh, don\\u2019t make me dance, Marge. [chuckles, kisses] [Bucky] Pick a good one. Mmm. Artie Shaw, Benny Goodman. [Marge laughs] Hey. You know, I am amazed that we\\u2019re friends. You don\\u2019t like to dance with a beautiful woman. You don\\u2019t drink. You don\\u2019t gamble. You don\\u2019t even like sports. Well, we are one of life\\u2019s great mysteries. [scoffs] [Marge chuckling] [\\u201cBegin the Beguine\\u201d playing] [chuckling] Oh, I love that. Yes. [friend] Yeah? [Marge chuckles] [sighs] Hmm. So this is it. [sighs] This is it. I\\u2019ll see you in a few weeks. If I don\\u2019t die first. Hate to break it to you, Bucky, but you are the 100th\\u2019s Air Executive now. You\\u2019re not going over there to fly missions. Look, I, uh\\u2026 I had a conversation with the CO over at the 389th, and I\\u2019m flying with those boys until you guys show up. I\\u2019ll be an observation pilot. You son of a bitch. Mm-hmm, yeah. Well, someone\\u2019s gotta taste a little combat, tell you what it\\u2019s really like up there. Well, don\\u2019t you die on me before I get over there. Don\\u2019t count on it. [Bucky] Keep your nose down! Let\\u2019s get this fire out! [pilot] Come on, faster! You have to help us! That\\u2019s it! The fire is out! Pull! Pull up! Up! [pilot shouting] Harder! [grunting, shouting] [pilot] Okay, leveling out! Almost there! [Bucky grunts] Fighters, 12:00! Dead ahead! [pilot] Oh, shit! We\\u2019ve lost the fourth flap. Pilot to navigator. We gotta head back. We need a new heading! Fuck! This is Duval. [grunting] And I\\u2019ve been hit. [Bucky] I\\u2019m coming down to you, Duval. Point it due west. Roger! We\\u2019re losing oil pressure on engine two! [Bucky] Keep it steady and I\\u2019ll get a new heading. [breathing shakily] Breathe, man! Just breathe! Hang on! [Duval grunting] Duval! Where are you hit? [shouts] Ah, fuck. Stay with me, Duval! [grunting] I\\u2019m right here. I\\u2019m not gonna make it, Bucky. [shouts] Stop it, Duval. You\\u2019re gonna make it. [grunts] Put your hand on the wound. [mumbles] Here. That\\u2019s good. [Duval] Okay. Okay. All right? Stay with me, goddamn it! [breathing heavily, shouts] You hear me? Look at me! Open your eyes! Open your eyes! Breathe, breathe, breathe! [breathing heavily, grunts] [pilot] Fighters, 12:00! [sergeant] Got one! [pilot] Egan, I need that heading! [Bucky] New heading: Turn left at 248. Roger! Come on. Stay with me. [Duval grunts] [Bucky] We\\u2019re headed home. Yeah. Yeah. Just keep breathing! [panting] [choking, gasping] That was a hell of an observation mission, Major. Are they all like that? You wondering what to tell your guys? Don\\u2019t say anything. They\\u2019ll figure it out. We all do. [airplanes passing] [crew member] The 100th bomb group was sent to England in the spring of 1943 to join the US Army\\u2019s Eighth Air Force in its battle against Nazi Germany. [lieutenant] I say we call this fort Alice From Dallas. Alice From Dallas? It\\u2019s got a ring to it. Alice From Dallas. Alice, our palace. Show Major Cleven. Lorch, show the major. I want her back. Hell of a dame. She\\u2019ll give this fort a little extra muscle. Oh. [chuckles] I see why you\\u2019d wanna name this fort after her. Aw, she\\u2019s special. She\\u2019s formidable. Amison, you sure you got us to the right fjord? Roger. 100%. [lieutenant] Nutting, how we looking back there? Eight in a line, sir. [lieutenant] Roger. [crew member] Most of us had never traveled far from home, let alone flown in an airplane. We came from every corner of the country, with a common purpose: to bring the war to Hitler\\u2019s doorstep. [Buck] Pilot to crew. We\\u2019ll be touching down in Greenland shortly to get some chow and some rest. Blondie Tower, Army 233. A flight of B-17s over Bluie West One. Landing instructions, please. [landing officer] Army 233, flight Blondie Tower. Continue for runway six. Clear to land. Sky CAVU. Winds 330 at 40, gusting to 50. Altimeter 2-niner-niner-0. It\\u2019s a little breezy. Breezy? In \\u2018Bama, we call that a hurricane. Roger, Blondie Tower. Continuing to runway six. Sky CAVU. Winds of 330 to 40, gusting to 50. [landing officer] Hell of a crosswind. Gusts increasing, fellas. Be careful. You might want to circle around, Major. Welcome to Greenland. Landing gear down. Get ready on flaps. [lieutenant] Landing gear coming down. It\\u2019s gonna get bumpy. Hang on, guys. [Buck] Pilot to crew. Prepare for landing. Left gear down. [grunts] Right\\u2019s down. Final-approach checks. Flaps at quarter? Yeah. Flaps at quarter. [grunting] Flaps at half. [lieutenant] Flaps are half. [crew members grunting] Flaps up. Got \\u2019em. [Buck] You gotta pull up, Veal. Come back around. [crew member] Our unit was made up of four squadrons. Major Gale Cleven was the commander of the 350th. He and Major Egan were the unquestioned leaders of our entire group. Ev Blakely was a pilot from Seattle. Look who it is. Blakely. [crew member] And big-hearted Benny DeMarco, from Philly. Major. DeMarco. Hell of a landing. Seen worse. Is that the fight? [Amison] Yeah. Claytor, you got money on this, right? I do. It\\u2019s bad signal though, man. Yeah, you don\\u2019t say. Well, turn it up. [crew member] Bombardiers James Douglass and Howard Hamilton were from the Midwest. Hambone. Major. Yep. [Claytor] Calm down. I got it. [crew member] And Charles Cruikshank, also known as Crank, was from New England. Hiya, Crank. Heard you boys had a rough landing. [crew member] My best friend Joe \\u201cBubbles\\u201d Payne and I were navigators, so location was important to us. Uh, Major? Lieutenant Crosby. Uh, where are you from? Yeah, we gotta put a pin in it. Bubbles and I\\u2026 we\\u2019re, yeah, you know, keeping the tradition alive. Got guys from all parts. Yeah. [chuckles] Ah. Casper, Wyoming. Cowboy State, huh? [chuckles] [Buck] Yep. Well, it looks like you\\u2019re the first, Major. How about that. [officers cheering, chattering] Major. What can I get for ya? A buddy of mine came through here some weeks ago. Group Air Exec. Uh, there was an incident. You friends with Egan? Major John Egan? Bucky? I am. Yeah. Whatever he said, I didn\\u2019t do anything wrong. No, he\\u2026 he just wanted me to give you this. Said it\\u2019s a replacement. A replacement? Yeah. [scoffs, sighs] [scoffs] And how exactly is this supposed to be a replacement? Sergeant, I don\\u2019t know what went on, but he told me that that should make up for it. You see that? Broken narwhal tusk? He pulled it down off the wall, pretended to be a unicorn. Ripped two of my couches, broke almost every glass in the bar. I see. You know, usually I can spot a troublemaker, but your friend seemed fine. Till he started to sing. Yeah, that sounds about right. \\u266a I asked her for credit She answered me nay \\u266a \\u266a Such a customer as you I can have any day \\u266a \\u266a And it\\u2019s no, nay, never \\u266a You don\\u2019t have to do this. It\\u2019s a stupid bet. \\u266a No, nay, never, no more \\u266a I have to now. \\u266a Will I play\\u2026 \\u266a [patron 1] Who\\u2019s it gonna be? All right, all right. [patron 1] Who\\u2019s it gonna be? [shushing] Now, I\\u2019ve played every one of ya\\u2026 [clears throat] \\u2026and you Irish are about as good at hitting that bull\\u2019s-eye as you are at hammering your nails. [patrons clamoring, laughing] I don\\u2019t know why you\\u2019re laughing. You English ain\\u2019t much better. Jack! But Tommy here, Tommy here is the best damn dart slinger in the whole of East Anglia! You\\u2019ll lose an eye. No, I won\\u2019t. I trust Tommy. [sighs] Now, he wins this, I get both those bikes. Yeah. You\\u2019re on, Yank. [Bucky] Both of \\u2019em. [patron 2] All right, both of them. And I get a kiss. All right, Tommy. Not my eyes. Not my eyes, Tommy. All right? [breathing deeply] [patron 3] Come on, Tommy. [breathing deeply] Whoo! All right, Tommy. Whenever you\\u2019re ready. [patrons cheering, laughing] [shouting] I just lost two bloody bikes, Tommy. What\\u2019s the matter with you? Tommy! [laughing] \\u266a Nothing but blue skies Do I see \\u266a \\u266a Not in England though Got shitty weather and blue skies \\u266a \\u266a Smiling at me \\u266a Evening, Major. Is that bike for sale? Not for all the money in the world. [Crosby] It was my job to get Captain Brady and the rest of our crew from Greenland to our base at Thorpe Abbotts in England. But somehow, we were separated from the rest of our group in the clouds over the Atlantic. Tough enough with zero visibility, but I had another problem: uncontrollable air sickness. [vomiting] [Brady] We have an electrical problem. We need a heading. Crosby, you there? Sorry. Could you repeat that? We got a gremlin in the electrical. Give us a holding pattern while we figure this out, Croz. Roger. Stand by. Turn right to 165. Over. [Brady] Roger. Turning right to 165. Shutting off electrical and recycling it. Let\\u2019s fix this. It\\u2019s gotta be one of the control circuits. I\\u2019ll pull the fuses. That\\u2019ll isolate the problem. Right. Go. [Hambone] How are you still vomiting? Your stomach\\u2019s gotta be as empty as our fuel tank. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. [laughs] [gasps] [Hambone] Ugh! Oh, gosh darn it, Croz. I\\u2019m sorry. It\\u2019s all over me. Get me a rag. I\\u2019m sorry, I\\u2019m sorry, I\\u2019m sorry. Come on. It stinks. [Brady] Come on. You got it? No gremlin as far as I can see. Maybe a problem with the wheel motor. [Brady] Restarting batteries and generators. [flips switch] Back on. Warning lights off. Is that the coast of England? Crosby, that\\u2019s England, right? Uh. No, we\\u2026 we shouldn\\u2019t be over water, Lieutenant. Sir, what\\u2019s your heading? 165, like you told me. Oh, good Lord in Heaven. Son of a bitch. That\\u2019s France! [explosions] Pilot to crew, flak ahead. Hold on. Shit! Goddamn it, Croz. [exhales sharply] [belches] [people chattering] [horn honks] [Bucky] Morris. Thanks for the bikes. I\\u2019ll get you next time. [laughs] Come on. [clicks tongue] There you go, lovely. Keep that way. Ooh, oh. Go on, girl. Here they come. [chattering] [children laughing] Come on, boy. DeMarco! Hey, Major. [Bucky] Where did you get that dog, Benny? I won him at craps. You took this baby above 10,000 feet. He\\u2019s got a mask. It cost me three bucks. But boy, he loves to fly. He wouldn\\u2019t stop howling. That\\u2019s because he\\u2019s part wolf. [chuckles] That wolf\\u2019s part dog. Got a name? Meatball. Welcome to the 100th, Meatball. Come on, Meatball. You miss me? Like a stone in my shoe. [laughs] How you been getting on? Uh, half our equipment\\u2019s yet to show up. Had to borrow masks and parachutes from the Brits. Air Exec ought to take care of that. My opinion: They ought to can the guy. Also, get used to the mud. Hey, listen, your, uh\\u2026 your radio guy pick up any chatter from the 418th? We\\u2019re missing Brady. Negative. Oh, I got you a bike. I need a bike? Or it\\u2019s a 20-minute walk from the quarters to the mess. And these things are sold out for weeks. I figure you\\u2019ll buzz past a bunch of guys crawling through the rain on the way to dinner. You\\u2019ll come around and say, \\u201cThank you, Bucky.\\u201d Don\\u2019t count on it. Well, there\\u2019s Brady. Okay, let\\u2019s check the landing gear. Bring it down. Roger. Left coming down. Tail down. Negative on right. Fuck. Right wheel won\\u2019t come down. Blum, get on the manual crank. [Blum] I\\u2019m on it. Hafer, you help him out. Roger, wilco. Take that. Where\\u2019s the crank? Come on. [grunts] [grunting] [Blum grunting] It won\\u2019t budge. Come on. [Blum] I\\u2019m trying. Come on. Get out of the way. Come on. Give it here. You got it? Yeah. [grunting] The landing gear motor must be fried or the jackscrew\\u2019s jammed up. You sure? [Blum] Yes, sir. [groans] It\\u2019s completely frozen. It\\u2019s not coming down. Bring the left landing gear up. You sure? Yeah, we got a better shot at walking away from a belly landing than we do on one wheel. Clear-up Tower, this is Army 071. Landing gear not responding. Requesting landing instructions. Over. [tower operator] Roger, Army 071, clear to land. Rescue crew at the ready. Over. [copilot] Roger, Clear-up. [Brady] Pilot to crew, prepare for crash landing. [Hafer] You hear that? Come on. Let\\u2019s go. Let\\u2019s go. [announcer] 247. Emergency personnel\\u2026 [soldiers clamoring, shouting] [grunting] [grunts] [breathes heavily] Okay. Get out! Everybody out. [Blum] Let\\u2019s go, go, go! Get the fuck out of here! Move! Move! Go, go, go, go. [siren blaring] Go, go! Come on! Get a move on. Run now or you\\u2019re dead. Go, go! [sirens continue] [emergency worker] All clear. [panting] Oh, fuck. Easy deal. Jack it up and hook it up. I\\u2019m on it. Let\\u2019s go. You\\u2019re a navigator, Crosby. You should be able to, I don\\u2019t know, find England. Everyone okay? Yes, sir. Sir. Brady. Step into my office. How\\u2019d you lose the rest of the squadron? We, uh\\u2026 We got separated in clouds. And, um, then we had some kind of electrical failure, so we spent an hour just trying to get the wheel down. Well, you know what they say. There are two kinds of pilots, those who have had a wheels-up landing and those who will. Major, it looks worse than it is. [Bucky] All right. Sort it out. [crew member 2] On it, Major. You didn\\u2019t have to cover for me, okay. It was my responsibility. I should\\u2019ve\\u2026 I wasn\\u2019t covering for you. We had a mechanical failure. Get a grip on that airsickness. Or get off my plane. [softly] Yes, sir. Croz, you take the scenic route? So, you wanna tell me about this unicorn story? Well, the unicorn is my favorite extinct animal. France? How the hell did you manage that? How else, Bubbles? [stammers] Puking my goddamn guts out. I thought that went away once you got going. [Crosby] No, yeah, it usually does. But this time with the turbulence, it kinda\\u2026 [stammers] \\u2026I don\\u2019t know. [sighs] This time it didn\\u2019t. [grunting] I gotta be the worst navigator in the entire Army Air Force. [grunts] Oh, Crosby, there\\u2019s gotta be somebody worse. [Bucky] Whoa. Hey. [Bubbles] At least one. Wrong side of the road, Lieutenant. [Crosby] Sir. [Bucky] Welcome to England. Now, you ask me, those two have watched Test Pilot a few too many times. You watched Test Pilot a few too many times. Yeah. [sighs] Didn\\u2019t help. Well, at least we get to tell \\u2019em which direction to point the plane. [Bucky] See ya, Buck. [Buck] Thanks for the lift. Normally the direct route. In your case, the scenic route. [Crosby] Oh, the scenic route? Oh, very funny. I wouldn\\u2019t have assumed I\\u2019d need to explain to you the gravity of your responsibilities. You are aware this isn\\u2019t just about how well your crews make their beds. I am, sir. Which is why I prioritize the flying more than their folding. You are in charge of 35 planes and 350 aircrewmen. Boys who have yet to experience combat. Their lives depend on order and discipline and your example. Yes, sir. [sighs] With all due respect\\u2026 I think I would be of more use to them and you as a squadron commander, rather than an Air Exec. Just because you spin the baton at the front doesn\\u2019t make you the band leader. I just don\\u2019t think I was made to sit behind a desk. I need to be up there helping my guys. Colonel LeMay has us in his sights. And he\\u2019s just itching to pull the trigger on the 100th Bomb Group. That\\u2019s not gonna happen on my watch. And I expect all officers to get in the game with me. That means you, Major Egan. You\\u2019re dismissed. [sighs] [retches] [groans] [breathing heavily] [guard] You okay, sir? Should I call the doctor? I\\u2019m all right. [breathes heavily] [Crosby] Within days, they woke us up for our first mission. With hundreds of hours of flight training in the States, we had to believe we were prepared. We had to, because now it was real. [soldier] Sir. Sir, you\\u2019re flying today. Major Cleven, sir. [Crosby] There was always a special breakfast on mission days: eggs, French toast, flapjacks, double rations of bacon, fresh grapefruit juice and a couple of cups of GI coffee. The men would come to call it the last supper. I hope we all we get back okay from\\u2026 Chuck, can you pass the salt, please? Uh-oh. [soldier] Oh, shit. He spilled the salt. [chuckles] Would you please toss the salt over your shoulder, so we can all get on with our breakfast? [shaker shatters] [soldier 2] Who did that? [soldier 3] Jesus. Not the whole thing, Chuck. [soldier 4] Doesn\\u2019t bring us bad luck. You said toss the salt. [soldier 2] Moron. He said toss the salt. Curt, I\\u2019m flying with you today. [DeMarco] Here you go. You\\u2019re what? Sorry, Dick. I know that puts you in the tail, but at least you\\u2019ll be able to shoot back. It\\u2019s all right. Is Meatball saddling up? Lemmons or Wink will watch him. You don\\u2019t wanna go on this one, buddy. I promise you. Well, I better get some of those eggs before they\\u2019re all gone. No, don\\u2019t bother, Buck. These eggs were hatched and powdered before my balls dropped. [chuckles] All right. I\\u2019ll pass on the eggs then. Morning, boys. [soldiers] Major Veal. Morning, sir. How\\u2019d you sleep? [sighs] Fucking great. Like a fucking baby. The new CO flying with us? The new CO, or the new, new CO? [soldiers laughing] Don\\u2019t worry about the CO. Worry about your flying. I want formation so damn tight you wouldn\\u2019t be able to slip a dime through our wingtips. [soldier 5] Yes, sir, Major Veal. [soldier 6] Yes, sir. Ah-ten-hut. [colonel] As you were. The target for today is Bremen. [soldiers clamor, laugh, whistle] We\\u2019ll be hitting the U-boat pens on the Weser River. Now, I cannot stress enough the importance of this target. We lost almost 70 cargo ships to U-boats last month alone. And if we can\\u2019t get material from the United States to Great Britain, we won\\u2019t be stepping foot on the continent. The 350th will be in high position with Major Cleven as lead pilot, and the 349th will be low with Major Veal as lead. I\\u2019ll be up front with Lieutenant Dye in the 351st. After formation, the 100th will join the 94th, the 95th, and the 96th bomber groups. We will be in the low-low. [soldiers sigh, whisper] Tail-end Charlie. [colonel] In a total wing strength of 78 heavy bombers. Fuck. Major Bowman, our Intelligence Officer, will take it from here. And Captain Becker will finish up with the weather. Major. [Bowman] Thank you, sir. Lights, please. [colonel] There you go. Note both naval and ground-based flak positions along the Frisian Islands, from Norderney to Langeoog. Over the mainland, you can expect concentrated flak from Wilhelmshaven, all the way down to Bremen. Identified batteries consist of 88 and 105 millimeter guns guided by W\\u00fcrzburg radar, so they will be tracking you. Navigators, bombardiers, once we\\u2019ve wrapped up here, be sure to report to HQ for a specialized briefing. Now, your IP is on the northwest side of Bremen, here. Target map, please. From that initial point, it\\u2019s a straight nine-mile run to the target. These are the pens on the east side of the river. Now, this central pen here will be your mean point of impact. And your heading on to the run-up will be 218 degrees true. Immediately after the turn, follow the river. Here you go, Major. Thank you. [Dick] Come on, Curt. [sighs] What\\u2019s your quote for the day? I\\u2019m gonna fly like an angel today, and not die like one. [chattering] Major, I think it\\u2019s too small. I can\\u2019t get it on. Thanks. There you go. Buck, give me a hand with this sheepskin. Yeah. [crew member 3] You good? You got this. We got this. I like your aftershave. Good. This is how close I want you on my wing today. Just like we trained for. Yes, sir. [person] Good morning, gentlemen. For those who don\\u2019t know me, I\\u2019m Father Teska. I\\u2019m right across the way\\u2026 Captain Phillips too, if anyone needs us. Thank you, Padre. We\\u2019ll be sure to keep that in mind. Mmm. [Bucky] Buck. Hey. You all right? [Buck] Yeah. What\\u2019s this? You settling accounts? It\\u2019s my lucky deuce. Your lucky\\u2026 Jesus, John. Here. Take it. I\\u2019ve gone on two missions with it already. I had two wheels down. Look, two corners bitten off. One for each mission. Here I am. Take it. [Curt] Get on in here. For luck. All right. [blowing kisses] See you later. [blows kisses] All right. See you all later. That\\u2019s where I\\u2019m going. Let\\u2019s circle up. As you know, it\\u2019s our first mission here. I trust you all to remember your training and know your jobs. Let\\u2019s knock one off, and drop bombs on those Nazi fucks, and we get to go home early. [crew] Yes, sir! Major here is gonna be flying with us. Major? First time in the sawmill, boys. Let\\u2019s rack \\u2019em up and knock \\u2019em down. [crew] Yes, sir. All right. Why are we still standing here then? [Buck] Everything okay back here, Dickie? Are you kidding? It\\u2019s cozy as a suite at the Ritz. [chuckles] Thank you. [sniffs, sighs] Gentlemen. Sir. We\\u2019re blessed to have you on our plane, sir. I feel the spirit of God in you. Yeah, in all of us, pal. You saved my seat. Yeah. Rather offer it to you than have you sit on my lap till I move. Ready for the checklist. [Curt] Form 1A? Check. Fuel transfer valves and switches? Both transfer valves are off and switch is off. Intercoolers are cold. Gyros? [lieutenant] Fuel shutoff switches? All four open. Cowl flaps? Open left and locked. Throttles? Throttles are closed. Master and ignition switches? Batteries on. And check. Booster pumps, pressure? [Dye] Pumps on. Fuel quantity, good. All right, Lieutenant, you ready to start engines? Yes, sir. Start one. Good to have you with us, Colonel. [engine starts] [Curt] Start two. Start two. Fuel pressure, oil pressure looking good. Start three. [Crosby] The B-17 had 12 machine guns protecting us from every side. We called it the Flying Fortress. But the key to our survival was sticking together, creating a combat box of defensive fire from a tight formation. It was important because if we got separated, the German fighters could pick us off one by one. [soldiers cheering] Give \\u2019em hell, boys! [cheering continues] Show \\u2019em green. [colonel] Here we go, fellas. [engine rumbling] Sixty. Ninety. 100. 110. Okay, boys. Here we go. [engine rumbling] [Curt] Forty. Fifty. Sixty. [cheering] Ninety. 100, 110. [Buck] Still climbing, boys. Three hours before we hit the target. After-takeoff checklist. Climb power is set. Cowl flaps are good. Right gear is up. [Buck] Left gear\\u2019s up. [sergeant] Tail wheel up. Okay, Bosser, let\\u2019s get you in the hole. [Buck] Okay, Curt, I got control. Pilot to crew. 10,000 feet. Masks on and check in. [Bosser] Ball turret, roger. Tail, roger. Right waist, roger. Left waist, okay. Radio, roger. [sergeant] Engineer, roger. Navigator, okay. Bombardier, roger. Best, pop a flare. Let\\u2019s see if we can get into formation in this soup. [Best] Roger that. Is that a flare? Nose to crew, I think I saw a flare right below us. Copy. You see who it came from? Negative. I can\\u2019t see a thing out there. Holy shit! B-17 12:00 low. They\\u2019re right below us. [copilot] Roy, pull up! Damn it! There\\u2019s a fort on top of us. Roger. I see him. [Claytor] Tail gunner, talk to me back there. Goddamn it, are we clear? Tail to pilot, we\\u2019re clear. [copilot] Jesus. That was close. [Claytor] That\\u2019s Cleven\\u2019s fort. I\\u2019d know that aftershave anywhere. [copilot] Are you serious? [Curt] I mean, you told him to stay close. [Buck] Not like that. Pilot to crew, we got another hour climbing through this muck. Keep your eyes peeled. [Veal] Christ. We need to catch up to the rest of the group. We\\u2019re way behind. Formation\\u2019s a mess. [rattling] [lieutenant] Engine one running rough. We\\u2019re losing it. [Veal] Shit. [Buck] Pilot to tail gunner. What can you see back there? Tail to Cleven, from our group we\\u2019ve got six in formation. The 351st is lined up but the 349th is way back. All six of \\u2019em. Looks like their lead, Veal, is trailing smoke. Roger. Redmeat Lead, this is Surface lead. What\\u2019s going on back there, Veal? [Veal] Surface Lead, having engine problems. Working on it. Roger. You need to make a decision, Veal. You\\u2019re putting your squadron in jeopardy. Pacer Lead, roger. [rattling] [lieutenant] Sir, we\\u2019re miles behind the group. The longer we wait, the longer it\\u2019ll take for them to catch up. [huffs] Goddamn it. Shut it down. Cutting fuel. [engine 1 stops] Feather that prop. Pacer Lead, this is Redmeat Lead. We\\u2019ve lost engine one. Can\\u2019t maintain this pace. We\\u2019re headed back. Copy, Surface Lead. [Veal] Redmeat Deputy, we have mechanical failure. I\\u2019m heading back. Lead is all yours. [colonel] Roger, wilco. Pilot to crew, we\\u2019re taking Redmeat Lead position. Go to maximum continuous power. Monitor our consumption. We\\u2019re gonna burn a lot of fuel catching up with the rest of the group. [siren blaring] [soldiers panting] [siren continues] [speaking German] [speaking German] Fire! Fire! Fire! Here we go. Flak incoming. Hold on, boys. [Bosser] Ball to crew, flak, 11:00 low. Flak 10:00 high. Four o\\u2019clock high. [Best] Flak, everywhere. May God rebuke him, we humbly pray. And do thou, O Prince of the heavenly host, by the power of God, thrust into hell Satan. [Curt grunting] [Buck] Navigator, what\\u2019s the ETA for our target? [navigator] About 11 minutes. Roger. [Curt] Eleven minutes? [grunts] The heavenly host, and all the evil spirits\\u2026 [left waist] Holy shit! [grunts] Who wander through the Earth, seeking the ruin of souls. Amen. [shrieks, pants] [Curt] Shit. Bombardier to command pilot, we should be over the target but I can\\u2019t see a damn thing. Should I drop? [colonel] It\\u2019s no good. It\\u2019s no good. Sir? I am not dropping bombs if we can\\u2019t see the damn target. Navigator, how does the secondary target look? [navigator 2] Navigator to command pilot, the same. Zero visibility, sir. Command pilot to crew, I\\u2019m scrubbing this mission. Navigator, prepare a new heading. [navigator 2] Roger. Zootsuit Two Lead to Zootsuit Two. Roger. Uncle. Fox. Xray. [Dye groans] [colonel] Repeat. Roger. Uncle. Fox. Xray. Damn it, CO\\u2019s scrubbing. Shit! Surface Lead to Pacer Lead, roger, wilco. Pilot to crew, mission scrubbed. Repeat, mission scrubbed. [bombing stops] Flak stopped. You know what that means, boys. Okay. Get ready, fellas. [left waist] Roger that, Major. Command pilot to tail, what do you see back there? [tail] I can\\u2019t get a read on the 349th. They\\u2019re still way back. Cleven\\u2019s group is close and tight with us. [colonel] Roger that. Keep an eye out for enemy fighters. Any second now, boys. Keep your eyes peeled. Top turret to crew, 12:00 high. Fighters! [tail] Jesus, they\\u2019re fast. He\\u2019s going after Veal\\u2019s crew. Fighters, 12:00 high! Fuck. [grunts] [screams] They got Adams. Oh, no. No. They gotta bail. Adams, bail out. Anyone see chutes? [tail 2] Tail to pilot, I don\\u2019t see any chutes. Roger. Keep calling out those fighters. Fighters! Twelve o\\u2019clock high! Schmalenbach\\u2019s hit. Oh, Christ. There goes Schmalenbach. [captain] Oh, shit. They\\u2019re coming straight for us. Jesus. [grunts] Mullins. [screams] Cleven to tail, what do you see back there? Tail to Cleven, the 349th are in a cloud bank. I don\\u2019t see them, sir. 190s coming back at us. Fighters, 6:00. Eight o\\u2019clock! Oh, man. [grunts] Fucking jammed. [pants] Fuck, fuck, fuck. Come on! [strains] Come on! Son of a bitch! [grunting] Jesus Christ. Tail, report. Dickie. [panting, grunting] Tail to Cleven, fighters are gone. I only see two left from the 349th, sir. Three forts are gone. Dickie, repeat. There\\u2019s only two left from the 349th, sir. Jesus. [Bosser] Ball turret to pilot. Sir, they shot a hole in the turret. I\\u2019m freezing to death. Can somebody get me out of here? [Buck] Hey, guys, get Bosser out of there and warm him up. Bosser okay back there? [right waist] We\\u2019re working on him, sir. Your suit\\u2019s all shot up. No wonder. Get him a blanket. Hang in there, boys.

(chuckles) Evangeline: Ah, right here. \\u266a Evangeline: Electric Blue, wasn\\u2019t it? You lied to me. Susan: Yeah, I knew Ray. Evangeline: And you just decided not to tell me. Your friend was dead. Susan: Yeah\\u2026 32 stabs. It\\u2019s a pretty clear message. Child: Mommy? (whimpers) Liz: Mac and cheese. You got any mac and cheese? Susan: Uh, yeah. It\\u2019s in the, uh\\u2013 Liz: Yeah, I\\u2019ll find it. Hey, do you know what the name of that unicorn is on your sweater? That\\u2019s Puddles. That\\u2019s what they called her \\u2019cause she cried a lot. All the mean unicorns called her that but she was just super hungry. Come on. Susan: It\\u2019s okay. Liz: We\\u2019re gonna go make some mac and cheese. Does that sound good? Child: Yeah. Liz: I\\u2019ma tell you all about Puddles. All her story about how she cooks mac and cheese. Here, sit down on this. Child: Okay. Evangeline: You need to start talkin\\u2019. Susan: (deep breath) I went to Tsalal to give haircuts to the men there. Annie came with me one time. Once. I didn\\u2019t wanna bring her. Sh-She wouldn\\u2019t take a no. She was, like, obsessed with coming. So, fuck it, I could use the company. Evangeline: And what happened that one time? Susan; Annie and Ray hit it off. They talked all night. She showed him her tattoo. He was, like, fixated on it. (light music playing) Evangeline: This one? Susan: Yeah, that\\u2019s it. Evangeline: Do you know what it means? Susan: She dreamt it. We were in high school. A buncha times. She got the tattoo, the dreams stopped. Liz: Alright. Stir, stir, stir. And then, all the unicorns went skating on the lake that Puddles had made with her rainbow tears. Woman; Ugh, I love skating. Susan: I thought it was gonna be a one-night thing. Pretty soon, they were hangin\\u2019 out all the time. Evangeline: And what about Clark? Was he\\u2026 violent? Anything to make you think he might do something? Susan: No. He was, he was quiet. He was-I mean, he was a little weird, but\\u2026 he was crazy about her. But Annie changed when they started goin\\u2019 out. Evangeline: Changed how? Susan: She didn\\u2019t want anybody to know they were together. And that was weird. Evangeline: You could\\u2019ve told me back then. I would\\u2019ve protected you. Susan: I was terrified. Plus, I was seeing a guy from Tsalal. Liz: Wait\\u2026 who? Susan: Oliver Tagaq. Liz: Oh, there-there\\u2019s, there\\u2019s no Oliver that works at Tsalal. Susan: He was the equipment engineer. He left right before Annie died. Liz: Um\\u2026 and, um\\u2026 do you know where we could find this Oliver? Susan: Last I heard, somewhere out on the ice. Probably hunting. I don\\u2019t think he\\u2019s lookin\\u2019 to be found. (deep breath) After they found her, I did call the police. I just didn\\u2019t wanna talk to you \\u2019cause you\\u2019da known me. So, I didn\\u2019t leave my name. But I told \\u2019em about Clark. Evangeline: Who\\u2019d you talk to? Liz: Prior, where\\u2019s your dad? Over. Peter (over radio): He\\u2019s still out in the search, Chief. Evangeline: There\\u2019s plenty of radio signal out there, he\\u2019s hidin\\u2019 his ass. Peter: I\\u2019ll get him to call the minute he gets back. Liz: Yeah, okay, you do that, and, um, see if you can find an Oliver Tagaq. He was an engineer six years ago at Tsalal. Got that? Peter: On it, over. Evangeline: That son of a bitch takes me off the case, and then he buries this lead? Liz: Question is, why is Hank fuckin\\u2019 around\\u2013 Evangeline: Don\\u2019t \\u201cAsk the question\\u201d me! Okay? I\\u2019ll tell you why he did it right now. It\\u2019s the fucking mine behind it. You know I\\u2019m right. Liz: I don\\u2019t know shit. Evangeline: Well, then you\\u2019re a shit detective. Liz: Yeah, well, whatever. Whatever you say. Evangeline: Annie protests against the mine, Annie gets murdered, the police shush it all, do the fucking math. Liz: You do the fuckin\\u2019 math. Evangeline: (sighs) Liz: Alright, without the mine, there\\u2019s no town. 50% of the population works for it, which means half the people who live here have got a reason to silence Annie K. And what about Clark, creepy boyfriend? What, you think the mine\\u2019s responsible for him too? According to your conspiracy theory, Tsalal and Clark had nothin\\u2019 to do with it. Is that it? Evangeline: Not sure yet. Liz: And what about her tongue? Now, what\\u2019s-what\\u2019s your explanation for her tongue poppin\\u2019 up six years after she dies? And what about the men on the ice? Why\\u2019d they go out there? \\u2026 Oh. (scoffs) Come on. Don\\u2019t give me that voodoo, E.T., cosmic choompa-loompa bullshit. Evangeline: (laughs) Are you tryna say \\u201cchupacabra\\u201d? LIz: Whatever, the magic. It\\u2019s no magic. (Evangeline scoffs) Liz: Alright, there\\u2019s a, there\\u2019s a real explanation for this. Evangeline: Alright. I\\u2019m listening. Liz: We\\u2019re just not askin\\u2019 the right questions. We will. We\\u2019ll find it. Evangeline: Who\\u2019s the one that believes in miracles? (phone chimes) Evangeline: Fantasy Football? Liz: No, Tinder. Evangeline: You\\u2019re on Tinder? Liz: Yeah, I\\u2019m on Tinder. Evangeline: Who the fuck is on Tinder in Ennis? Fuckin\\u2019 Old Norman Naki and, ugh, Hank Prior? Liz: No, he\\u2019s taken. (chuckles) Poor bitch. Yeah, I set my Tinder radius for Fairbanks. Ya know, I\\u2019ll take some personal trips. I don\\u2019t fuck where I eat. Evangeline: (snorts) You mean, anymore. Liz: Fuck you. What do you do when you\\u2019re lonely? Evangeline: I watch Netflix. Liz: Come on. For real. What do you do? Evangeline: I pray. Liz: Liz snorts) (laughing) You pray? What do you mean, like, like, get on your knees, \\u201cOur Father, who art in heaven,\\u201d pray? (chuckles) Oh, come on. You kiddin\\u2019 me? You talk to God? Evangeline: No. I listen. Liz: Oh. Evangeline: Don\\u2019t you ever\\u2026 get this feeling, like\\u2013 that sometimes you just wanna (sighs) just disappear? Just walk out\\u2026 never stop? Just go. Just go. (light music playing) (singer vocalizing) (singers vocalizing) Hank: Hey. Peter; Chief Danvers wants you to call\\u2013 Hank: She can wait. Come here for a second. Uh, I was cleanin\\u2019 out the garage and I found these. Yeah, I know, Darwin\\u2019s only four, but, uh, you were already a pretty damn good little skater by that age, so. If ya\\u2026 take him out, shoot me a text, huh? Peter: Yeah, sure. Hank: What\\u2019s Danvers up to? Peter: Uh, she\\u2019s goin\\u2019 through the trailer\\u2019s evidence. Hank: She and Navarro? Peter: Yeah. Hank: I don\\u2019t know what the hell they\\u2019re doin\\u2019 together. I thought they hated each other. Peter: You know what happened there? She won\\u2019t tell me. Hank: No idea. Evangeline: Hey! You received a direct call about Annie K\\u2019s and Raymond Clark\\u2019s relationship. A direct call, and you didn\\u2019t report it? Hank: Danvers, tell your girl here to stand down. Evangeline: You talk to me. Tell me why the fuck you withheld information from a murder investigation? Hank: Oh, please. That woman was sleeping with half of Ennis. What did you want me to do? Log every dude she was banging in the region? Evangeline: You piece of shit.

And you, go back to your fuckin\\u2019 search\\u2026 and get rid of your hillbilly friends. Or you\\u2019re gettin\\u2019 a negligence report for your mishandling of the Kowtok case. Hank: Maybe I oughta file a report on you for playing Mrs. Robinson with my kid. Hm? Liz: You do your fuckin\\u2019 job. Evangeline: That\\u2019s it? \\u201cDo your fucking job\\u201d? That\\u2019s all he gets? Liz: Hey, where you goin\\u2019? Evangeline: Fuck outta here. Peter: Who\\u2019s Mrs. Robinson? Liz: (sighs) Where\\u2019s my forensic tech? Peter: Well, there\\u2019s a blizzard out in North Bay. Visibility\\u2019s shit. No planes are takin\\u2019 off, so they\\u2019re gonna try again tomorrow. Liz: Ah, tomorrow\\u2019s no good. They\\u2019re gonna thaw. And they\\u2019re gettin\\u2019 shipped out to Anchorage. Peter: Well, I have an idea. Liz: What? Peter: I don\\u2019t know if you\\u2019re gonna like it. Liz: Well\\u2026? Peter: My cousin lives in White Lake. He\\u2019s a vet. Works a lot with large animals. Liz: How long before you can get him here? Peter: Well, I can call him right now and see. Liz: Yeah. Peter: Yeah? Liz: Yeah. (tense music playing) (music softens) Evangeline: (shouts) Qavvik! Qavvik: Shh! (wind blowing) Qavvik: Fucker. What can I do for you? Evangeline: (sighs) Do you know Oliver Tagaq? He worked at Tsalal for a bit. Now he might be a hunter, somewhere out on the ice. Qavvik: Tagaq? No. Evangeline: Well, thing is, I know you know someone who knows someone. Homebrew comes with a network. You\\u2019ll ask around? Qavvik: Mm-hmm\\u2026 for a price. Evangeline: You want me to pay you? Qavvik: It\\u2019s called quid pro quo. You tell me something. I tell you something. Evangeline: (scoffs) Don\\u2019t get fuckin\\u2019 cute on me. Qavvik: I\\u2019m not kidding. You tell me something about yourself\\u2026 and I\\u2019ll get you that intel. Evangeline: Fuck you, Qavvik. (door slams) Qavvik: Always lovely to see you, Evangeline. (whistling) Evangeline: (sighing) (door opens, closes) Evangeline: Da fuck you wanna know? Qavvik: Your mom. Tell me about her. Evangeline: Ask Julia. Qavvik: Mm-mm, I\\u2019m asking you. She was local, wasn\\u2019t she? Evangeline: Yeah, from a gold mining camp that\\u2019s gone. She left when she was 15. Met my dad in Boston. Boom. Now get me Tagaq. Qavvik: That\\u2019s that accent, Boston girl. (chuckles) But you didn\\u2019t stay. Evangeline: No. Dad was bad. He drank. He hit her. Us too. So Mom took us and ran. And then we came back up North. Qavvik: Alaska girls always come back. Evangeline: She was\\u2026 not okay. She\\u2013 Qavvik: Like Jules? Evangeline: Yeah. Voices. Episodes. (light, tense music playing) Evangeline: Then one day she ran out and never came back. Qavvik: Was she\\u2013 Evangeline: She was killed. Fucker was never found. Qavvik: (sighs) Oh. Fuck. Sorry, Eve. \\u266a Evangeline: She never told me my Inupiaq name, you know? I wish\\u2013 Nothing. Anyways, there\\u2019s your intel. Now get me mine.

They\\u2019re fucking lying when they say they\\u2019re not poisoning us. We want the truth. (crowd cheering) Hunter: We want truth! We want clean water! We want clear skies! We want our animals healthy! (cheering) Hunter: We want the mine to close. (chants) Close the mine! Hunter: This town was here before them. We were here before! Crowd (chanting): We were here before!

Leah: I want you to fucking care. Liz: I do care. Leah: Bullshit. Liz: I told you to wipe that shit off your face. Come on. Leah: Did you know Aviaq Carter\\u2019s baby was stillborn today?

I-I think they died before they froze. Liz: What? Vince: I-I mean, they didn\\u2019t freeze to death. I\\u2019ve seen plenty of frozen animals, and cold makes their heart rate drop, their breath grows shallow. They basically fall asleep. All told, a pretty peaceful death. Those guys, this\\u2026 this is not how you die in the cold. It\\u2019s just not. Liz: What killed \\u2019em? Vince: It\\u2019s hard to tell without a chance to properly postmortem them, but looks like cardiac arrest if I had to put money on it. Liz: Oh, well, how can you be sure? Vince: I can\\u2019t. I\\u2019m just a vet, ma\\u2019am. But I\\u2019ve seen caribous die of plain fright. Running, terrified. Uh, these scientists, they, they, uh, they look the same.

There\\u2019s no birth certificates, there\\u2019s no school records, no taxes, nothing for him. Liz: Oh, so, so, nothing from Tsalal\\u2019s records. Peter: Yeah, nothin\\u2019 on the Tsalal records. There\\u2019s nothin\\u2019. Evangeline: Well\\u2026 he\\u2019s living in a nomad camp on the North Shore. Liz: Alright.

We\\u2019re looking for a Oliver Tagaq. And that would be why? Liz: Well, we believe that he may have some information, uh, regarding Tsalal station. Evangeline: Sir\\u2026 Mr. Tagaq is not a suspect. We just need to chat with him. (crying baby in distance) Not sure he\\u2019s around. Evangeline: Mr. Tagaq? Alaska police. (Liz sighs) Liz: Hear that? Evangeline: Yeah, the genny. Yeah, he\\u2019s around, alright. Liz: Oh, yeah? Oh, okay. That\\u2019s good. Evangeline: (quietly) What the fuck are you doing? Oliver Tsalal: You\\u2019re standing on traditional Inupiaq territory. Liz: Uh, well\\u2013 Oliver: Unless you have an order, if you take one step in, I\\u2019ll blow your brains out. Liz: Uh\\u2026 I hear ya. So, if I go in the state records\\u2026 this property is your land? It\\u2019s under your name, Mr. Tagaq? Oliver: You wanna come and see the deed, lady? You. What\\u2019s your name? Evangeline: I\\u2019m A.T. Evangeline Navarro. Oliver: No. (speaks Inupiaq) Who are you? Evangeline: I just told you. Oliver: Oh, you forgot, didn\\u2019t you? Evangeline: We\\u2019re here to talk about Annie Kowtok. Oliver: Annie? Look, I don\\u2019t care what you came here to talk about. If you don\\u2019t have an arrest order, you need to leave. Liz: What, you want us to get one? We can get one. Oliver: An arrest for what? Liz: How about the deaths of the Tsalal scientists? (light, tense music playing) Evangeline: Your ex-colleagues. They\\u2019re dead. Oliver: (heavy breathing) Evangeline: They all died a week ago. Oliver: How? Evangeline: (sighs) They died on the ice. We still don\\u2019t know what happened. Oliver: Lund is dead? Evangeline: No. No, he\\u2019s in the hospital. He\\u2019s not doing well. Listen\\u2026 you can talk to us if there\\u2019s anything you know. Oliver: Get the hell out of my house! Evangeline: No, we just wanna\\u2013 (pumps shotgun) Oliver: Go, now! Evangeline: Alright. Oliver: (yelling in Inupiaq) Get outta here. Out! Evangeline: We\\u2019re gone, we\\u2019re gone. Oliver: Go, now! Don\\u2019t ever come back! (dog barking) Liz: (sighs) What was all that shit about your name? Evangeline: You wouldn\\u2019t understand. Lulu (over radio): Chief. Liz: Danvers. Lulu: Chief, we got a call, from the hospital. Liz: Lund? Lulu: Yeah. (siren wailing) Nurse 1: The gangrene spread everywhere. He needed multiple amputations. He lost his eyesight. We kept him heavily sedated, but a few hours ago, he started waking up. Liz: Is he communicating? Nurse 1: He comes in and out. He\\u2019s agitated. (person wailing) Nurse 1: Be prepared. He\\u2019s hard to look at. (Anders Lund wailing) Nurse 1: Please be quick.

(Anders wails) Liz: Anders\\u2026 I\\u2019m here. Okay? Anders. Anders. Anders: (struggles) W-We woke her. Voice (whispers): She\\u2019s awake. Anders: And now she\\u2019s out. She\\u2019s out there in the ice. Liz: Who\\u2019s out there? Anders: She came for us\\u2026 in the dark. (Anders wailing) Nurse 1: I\\u2019m sedating him. Liz: No. Who-Who\\u2019s out there? (distant arguing) Liz: Who was it? Who is she? Who-Who came for you? Anders, who? Nurse 2: There\\u2019s been an accident on the police search. Chief Danvers, we need help!

Secretive Teresa has clues but won\\u2019t share. Spade digs deeper, unaware the killer may target him next. * * * [Birds chirping] [Ominous music] [Doctor speaking French] What monster\\u2026? Doctor? Let\\u2019s go. [Door slams shut] Terribly sad. Outside of the antique, I barely got you for St. Valentine\\u2019s or whatever. Do you still possess a working pistol? Anyone who wants to shoot me will have to bring their own gun. I have no idea what that means, but it has the ring of your usual moral foolishness. Still, there\\u2019s a madman running around. You might want to protect yourself with something more reliable than just your wits. [Slow jazz music] [Engine revving] [Liquid pouring] [Glass clinks] [Clock ticking] [Speaking French] Is it true? The sisters? All of them? [Clock ticking] Where\\u2019s Teresa? [Speaking French] I prepared the blue room for her. Let the poor thing sleep. Whatever you need from her will wait. [Door slams shut] [Crickets chirping] [Gasping] [Ominous music] [Heavy breathing] [Distant clunks] [Radio playing in background] [Speaking French] Someone slept late? How did your meeting at the bank go? In order to get a loan, I would need to have almost as much as I want to borrow. [Speaking French] Why don\\u2019t you ask Sam? [Speaking French] Don\\u2019t start. [Speaking French] You wore the necklace. [Speaking French] Fuck luck. Always. [Speaking French] Or forget the bank and sell it? [Speaking French] When Gabrielle gave this to me, she said \\u201cGive rubies away, but not your precious heart.\\u201d [Speaking French] Wait. Leave it on. [Speaking French] What happened to us? [Speaking French] I don\\u2019t know. The war? [Speaking French] The easy answer. [Speaking French] Maybe you could pretend that I am someone else. Teresa? [Knocking] [Ominous music] Have you seen Teresa? [Speaking French] This morning? No. Is she not in the bedroom? No. [Speaking French] Well, she couldn\\u2019t have gone far. Not on foot. She could have. If she left last night. Or if someone came and took her. [Slow string music] [Engine revving] [Breaks squealing] Cheeky little automobile, Mr. Spade. Out to enjoy some of that fresh country air, are we? Something like that. Ah, both you and the girl. You saw her? Yes. At dawn, I was on my way here. The colors at sunrise are a painter\\u2019s dream. She was on the road? She came past me. Her shoes were muddy. As if she\\u2019d been running. And her eyes, they were downcast. Seemingly upset. What color were they? I think they were\\u2026 Ah, yes. Sorry, a bit obsessed with details. Occupational hazard, I\\u2019m afraid. Yeah, you said she was upset? Yes, well, I imagine the massacre at the manor was the cause. Oh, you heard about that, huh? Everyone\\u2019s heard about that. From the girl? No, I waved. Tried to chat with her, but she just ignored me. Can\\u2019t say I blame her. Pardon? [Engine revving] [Intense orchestra music] [Distant dog barking] [Car door slams shut] Teresa? [Mysterious piano music] [Water sloshing] [Scrubbing floor] You\\u2019re asking the wrong guy. In my experience, the better souls never stand a chance. [Ominous music] [Ominous music intensifies] [Bell tolls] [Bell tolls louder] [Sam coughing] [Slow string music] [Chain rattling] [String music intensifies] These things will kill you. These are the same ones doctors smoke. I saw on TV. [Coughing] Yeah, you really seem to be enjoying them. Yeah, all right, climb down before you make yourself dizzy and break your neck. I\\u2019m not leaving. Philippe\\u2019s not coming. He promised. I\\u2019m sure he did. Did you do this? No. You know who did? How could I? We\\u2019re not allowed up here. And yet, here you are. They\\u2019re all dead. What difference did their useless rules make? I\\u2019ll tell you what. You stay and wait for your father to show up, smoke to your lungs\\u2019 content. I\\u2019ll be back at sundown. If you\\u2019re still hanging around, you come home with me. If not, then swell knowing you and I hope you and Philippe have a nice life on the run. [Barn door opening] Shit! [Engine revving] Any idea how she ended up inside the chapel last night? I don\\u2019t play with dolls anymore. So, no idea how she lost her head? I gave her away years ago. You know this car still smells like roses. She\\u2019d bring treats to the orphanage at Christmas. Gabrielle. Oranges from California. Imagine that. Sometimes she\\u2019d bring me books or a blouse, or some other piece of clothing she was done with. The books were all in French. She said that once I started to dream in French, I\\u2019d be fluent. She said the same to me. Sadly for everyone, I still dream in English. Though usually French wins. She didn\\u2019t want me to hate you, for what you did to my father. [Gunshot] Get down. [Tires screeches] [Intense music] [Engine revving] Stay down. [Gunshot] [Tires squeal] You all right? [Motorcycle revving] [Engine revving] [Intense string music] [Motorcycle revs in distance] Mr. Spade? Nasty business. This car\\u2019s cursed. Not the person who shot that window, that\\u2019s for sure. Are you saying they missed on purpose? The car was moving too slowly for the gunman not to have hit me. And what about the second shot? Self-defense. I was about to run him over. Yes, of course you were. I\\u2019m not even sure it was meant for me. George: Ah! Lovely. That\\u2019s great. That\\u2019s my new neighbor. An odd fellow. [Sighs] Philippe could have taken the shot. With Teresa in the car? Hard to imagine even Philippe doing that. And he\\u2019s wounded, which shouldn\\u2019t make him too hard to find for a pair of top detectives like you and\\u2026 [In French] your idiot brother. Samuel, we talked about you using words like \\u201cmoron\\u201d and \\u201cidiot\\u201d when speaking to my brother. Terms of endearment. We\\u2019ve checked the two hospitals in the area. No one with a bullet wound has been admitted. Same goes for veterinarians and dentists. Sounds like you two are right on top of things. [Footsteps] Mr. Spade, can I borrow your lawyer? You were four years old. [Pencil scrawling on paper] [Bike chain winding] Henri: I took her to Le Canard Noir, that old place in Rodez. Set me back 20 francs. I\\u2019ll take care of that. Best 20 francs I ever spent. With that stupid grin, I\\u2019ll assume that you and Mademoiselle Ruse are once again exchanging\\u2026 [In French] the heat of passion. In the General\\u2019s office. On his desk. I hope one of you didn\\u2019t wrinkle Philippe\\u2019s file. Sergeant Saint-Andre\\u2019s file is rather short. On several pages, names, dates, places are blacked out. He\\u2019s army intelligence. I\\u2019m sorry, I couldn\\u2019t get more. That\\u2019s plenty. Philippe, a spy. I guess the war really did deplete the supply of able men. There was something I heard, just a rumor. Well, there\\u2019s this bow near the base, where a lot of ex-Deuxi\\u00e8me Bureau guys hang out. Every so often, I go there for a drink, and the other night, there was some joking about Saint-Andre hiding a young woman in his quarters his last time on base. He\\u2019s probably not the first. The woman was Algerian. No one heard her name. Thank you, Henri. Much appreciated. Any time. I must confess, since I was a child, you\\u2019ve been my hero. Your hero? Oui. My advice, trade up. [Water splashes] [Ominous music] [People talking in the distance] [Romantic Latin music] Woman: You know what they say, \\u201cMarry for money, divorce for love.\\u201d I thought it was, \\u201cmarry for money, earn every nickel.\\u201d Which do you believe? I\\u2019ll get back to you. You forget something, sweetheart? We\\u2019re having a swim, aren\\u2019t we? What will the gardener think? I\\u2019m not worried about the gardener leaving me for someone younger. If I were you, I\\u2019d be more worried about mosquito bites. I\\u2019m not going anywhere. I\\u2019m just reminding you, there\\u2019s more to me than my money. How could I ever forget? [Water splashes] Doctor: Why must the innocent always pay for the rest of us, for our sins? When the Nazis paid their little visit, mother superior ran guns for the underground. Your point? No one\\u2019s innocent. Still, one tries to be on the right side of things. If only one knew what that was. Six dead nuns, five files. Which one is missing? I know these women. I examined them every six months. Three were from Spain, one was from Portugal, and the mother superior was born here. The last was an African. We had not yet met. There\\u2019s no file for her. I met that one briefly. [Coughs] Can I see the bodies? Patrice had them all bagged for transport to Paris. Does Patrice really want Paris crawling up and down his town? He does not, but he understands that six massacred nuns, or dead nuns in any number, bring much unwanted pressure. And Paris is better equipped. The extent of the autopsies I can do run from death from fall off ladder to death from heart attack. Don\\u2019t forget boredom. You joke, but the ministry was quite serious and quite clear in their instruction. I was not to touch the bodies. Of course, they said that after I found this around the neck of the African. [Bell rings] [Envelope rustles] I didn\\u2019t know nuns were allowed to wear jewelry. [Locket clicks] Real nuns, that is. [Suspenseful orchestral music] [Discordant music] [Laughing] [Clock ticking] [Suspenseful piano and orchestral music] [Footsteps approaching] [Door opens] [Gun clatters] [Gun clatters] -[Door thuds and squeaks] [Door slams] We must wait for the replacement windows to come from England. How long? [Dog barking] Who shot you? Technically, I was shot at. Just a second. I care about this car, so whatever your feelings for the late Jacques Laveront, promise me you\\u2019ll take good care of her. I\\u2019ll treat the car as I would any beautiful woman I despise, with respect in her presence and lust in her absence. Good, then we understand each other. I think. Ciao, Anatole.Sam. Just happened to be passing by? No one has been shot or shot at here for a long time. Not since the war. And that was collaborators killing partisans and partisans killing collaborators, not some crazy person executing nuns. There\\u2019s been another war since, in case you\\u2019ve forgotten. And we both know that one\\u2019s made plenty of people crazy and desperate. This is not really about people though. This is about you. There are six dead women who might say otherwise. That was yesterday. Today someone shot at you. But you\\u2019re not worried about me. Could Jean-Pierre have done this? Sure, he could have, but he didn\\u2019t. How do you know? He\\u2019s all talk. But murder, no. Jean-Pierre would disagree. So would every man who went to war. That\\u2019s why they give them medals, with snappy uniforms to pin them on. That way, whenever they look in a mirror, they see a soldier. And what about the man who burns his uniform and sells his medals? What does he see? You may think you understand him, but you make him feel small. You make most men feel small. That\\u2019s because they don\\u2019t know me. Then, I\\u2019ve never much cared what other men thought of me. Not caring doesn\\u2019t make one bulletproof. You should needle point that one on a pillow. Sometimes, Sam\\u2026 [Birds chirping] [Cuckoo cooing] Spade, I\\u2019d like you to meet my mother. Lady Cynthia, Sam Spade. How do you do, Mr. Spade? I\\u2019ve been better. I\\u2019m so sorry for invading your devastatingly attractive home without being asked, but George said he\\u2026 he didn\\u2019t think you\\u2019d mind. I don\\u2019t. Nice to meet you. Oh, Mr. Spade. Um, please feel free to say no, but may I ask you an enormous favor? Sure, you can ask. I\\u2019ve never seen the landscape my husband painted for your late wife. Um, would you mind, terribly, if I came inside with you and took a peek? May I come, too? I\\u2026 I haven\\u2019t laid eyes on that painting since the day of the unveiling. More the merrier. Ah. Ah. George and I have rented the villa next door. Uh, we\\u2019re neighbors. Though, of course, it\\u2019s hardly as scrumptious as all this. Gabrielle\\u2019s family got the house on the cheap. The previous owner died suddenly. Oh. He was guillotined. [Cynthia gasps] In fact, he got his head chopped off right after Marie Antoinette. Oh, dear. Mother, he\\u2019s pulling your leg. Oh, capital. [Laughing] Oh, you\\u2019ll find I\\u2019m extremely gullible, Mr. Spade. Somehow, I doubt that. [Door opens] Oh, thank you. George, look at this marvelous place. Oh, they don\\u2019t make them like this anymore, do they? Ooh, oh, oh. [George and Cynthia sighing and laughing] It\\u2019s just wonderful! Yes, Mother, notice the shadowing. Ah. Ah. Singeon\\u2019s sense of color was always divine. And look, George, look how he\\u2019s captured the\\u2026 the delicate flesh tones of this lovely, naked lady. Well, I\\u2019ll leave you two to show yourselves out. Yes, thank you so much. Awfully kind of you. [clock chimes] Oh, one more thing. I believe we have a mutual friend, Philippe Saint-Andre. I wouldn\\u2019t say that Philippe and I are friends, more like, a long time ago, we bumped into each other. Oh, oh, I\\u2026 I\\u2026 I\\u2026 I see. Well, I\\u2026 I hear he\\u2019s returned to Bazuel. I would love to say hello. I\\u2019m afraid I can\\u2019t help you. I\\u2019ve no idea where he is. Mm, pity. How do you know Philippe? Well, uh, years ago, he purchased one of my husband\\u2019s masterpieces. Really? Mm. He paid a generous sum for it, too. Are you sure we\\u2019re talking about the same Philippe Saint-Andre? The Philippe I know isn\\u2019t one to part with a generous sum, or any kind of sum, for anything that he could just as easily take. [Radio announcer speaking French] [Item thuds] No. [Footsteps retreating] [Birds chirping] Well, this morning, I had to get a ride from Basem to buy two new tires. You had to slash the spare, too? I don\\u2019t know what you\\u2019re talking about. You sound like your mother. That was her favorite answer to every question. \\u201cI don\\u2019t know what you\\u2019re talking about.\\u201d It was like a tick. [Coughs] And that\\u2019s what you get for saying such things about my mother. [Sam coughing] Are you all right? Are you sick? Couldn\\u2019t be better. Just tell me where you saw this glint. Yeah, no one\\u2019s gonna take a shot from there. What\\u2019s that? Is that a clue? Right now, it\\u2019s just an empty pack of cigarettes. Well, they haven\\u2019t been here very long. Really? Yeah, it was windy last night, so if the pack was here before, it would\\u2019ve been covered in leaves. Interesting theory. Okay, tell me what you saw in the chapel. I\\u2019m really hungry. Teresa. Helena said she\\u2019s making me ravioli. What did you see in the chapel? I told you. That monk fellow hit the mother superior and then we all ran away. Yeah, you said that before, and you were very convincing, but someone locked the kids in the closet, and this morning, someone took a shot at you. At me? To scare you, to keep you from talking, which means you either saw something you shouldn\\u2019t have seen or you know something you shouldn\\u2019t know. Why did Philippe come running to you? I\\u2019m his daughter. You\\u2019re his daughter, yet he didn\\u2019t feel the need to fill you in on who shot him and why? He was protecting me from knowing things I shouldn\\u2019t. Protecting you how? By then, just leaving you alone? [Birds chirping] My father didn\\u2019t come to see me. He was there to meet someone else, one of the sisters. Which one? The new one, soeur Angelique. Then his plans changed when he got shot. [Locket clatters] Yeah, that\\u2019s them. \\u201cThem\\u201d? What, the kid was with her? No, he came a month later with Papa. So, Philippe shows up wounded, with a kid, and tells you what? To hide the boy while he found a place to stay and got patched up. He said he\\u2019d come back for us in a day. He leaves the kid with you, takes off, and the monk comes knocking. [Birds chirping] I was hiding Zahid in the tower when I heard the kids screaming. [Children screaming] They were running from the chapel. They said a priest hit\\u2026 [In French] mother superior. So, you didn\\u2019t actually see him hit her like you\\u2019ve been saying? No. Then what? You locked the kids in the closet? To keep them safe. [Door slams] [Key rattles] Shh, shh! I ran back to my room. And heard the first gunshot. [Gun fires] [Monk speaking in French] The monk was shouting. [Monk and nuns whispering in French] He was telling soeur Angelique that she had to watch while he asked each of them where the boy was. [Gun clicks] [Monk speaking in French] And when they wouldn\\u2019t say\\u2026 [Gun fires] he shot them\\u2026 one by one. [Nuns whispering in French] [Gun clicks] [Monk talking in French language] [Nun screams] [Gun fires] [Teresa panting] [Nun moans] [Gun fires] [Gun clicking] [Nun screams] [Gun fires] [Nun screams] [Gun fires] I tried to close my eyes, but I couldn\\u2019t look away. And then\\u2026 Then what? He saw me. [Gasping] [Thuds] [Teresa panting] [Monk grunts] [Knife scrapes] So, you told him where the boy was? No. You weren\\u2019t afraid? I had my knife. Well, sadly, I lost it. In the chapel? In the monk. [Knife stabs] [Monk screams] [Squelches] [Footsteps thudding] [Door slams] I ran to the bell tower, but the boy was gone. Who is this kid that someone would kill six people to find him? I don\\u2019t know. But right before he killed her\\u2026 Soeur Angelique said something. The Mahdi? What the hell has your father gotten you into? [Suspenseful orchestral music] [Suspenseful orchestral music continues] [Wood clatters] [Suspenseful orchestral music intensifies] \\u266a \\u266a \\u266a\\u266aLet\\u2019s play a game, you and I, called \\u201cI won\\u2019t lie to Sam.\\u201d \\u266a We got a meeting with the bishop. Want to come along? As long as no one asks me to confess. Mr. Spade, do you have any specific information you want to share? I just did. I need to find Philippe. [Chuckles] If I want you dead, I just have to wait. [Telephone rings] You want to have a real conversation, knock on my door. \\u266a \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Your email address will not be published.

Crafted by the creative duo John Shiban and John Orloff, and further developed by Orloff for Apple TV+, this series marks a significant addition to the platform\\u2019s offerings. The narrative is rooted in Donald L. Miller\\u2019s 2007 book, \\u201cMasters of the Air: America\\u2019s Bomber Boys Who Fought the Air War Against Nazi Germany.\\u201d It vividly recounts the harrowing experiences of the 100th Bomb Group, a B-17 Flying Fortress squadron in the Eighth Air Force during World War II. Known infamously as the \\u201cBloody Hundredth,\\u201d this group was distinguished by the severe casualties it suffered in the thick of battle. \\u201cMasters of the Air\\u201d stands as a companion piece to the esteemed series \\u201cBand of Brothers\\u201d (2001) and \\u201cThe Pacific\\u201d (2010), completing a trilogy of sorts in war-time storytelling. Notably, it is the first series to be produced by Apple Studios, in collaboration with Playtone and Amblin Television, showcasing a significant investment in quality historical drama. The production, which commenced in England in 2021, faced numerous setbacks due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite these challenges, \\u201cMasters of the Air\\u201d successfully premiered on January 26, 2024, demonstrating resilience and commitment to bringing a pivotal era of history to the screen. * * * The premiere episode of \\u201cMasters of the Air\\u201d introduces key members of the 100th Bomb Group during World War II, such as Gale \\u201cBuck\\u201d Cleven and John \\u201cBucky\\u201d Egan. The episode, blending fact with fiction, confirms some historical details, like the B-17 Flying Fortress named \\u201cAlice from Dallas,\\u201d but leaves others, such as Bucky\\u2019s narwhal tusk incident, ambiguous. Key plotlines involve challenging landings, airsickness leading to navigational errors, and the introduction of a dog named Meatball. The episode culminates in the 100th Bomb Group\\u2019s first mission, a disastrous affair resulting in significant losses, mirroring historical events. Personal struggles are also depicted, including a soldier\\u2019s hands freezing to his gun and a colonel\\u2019s unexplained illness, likely drawn from personal anecdotes rather than public records. * * * [captains sigh] [captain 1] Two more. [bartender] Coming right up. Bucky\\u2019s got all the luck. Yeah, she\\u2019s pretty. No, not that. Lucky bastard\\u2019s shipping out tomorrow. He\\u2019s gonna be a stone\\u2019s throw away from the Krauts, while the rest of us will still be flying practice missions over Nebraska. Ah. Don\\u2019t worry. We\\u2019ll be over there dropping bombs soon enough. Yeah. Bucky, next round\\u2019s on us. He\\u2019s never done that before. [chuckles] So you\\u2019re Bucky, and he\\u2019s Buck? Uh, it\\u2019s a long story. They make a nice pair, don\\u2019t they? Oh, I should have introduced them earlier. He\\u2019s leaving tomorrow. Everyone needs someone to write to back home. I don\\u2019t know if John Egan\\u2019s the pen pal type. Hmm. Well, maybe if he met a girl worth writing to, he would be. Ah. Well, a girl worth writing to is hard to find. Not if you know where to look. Ah. I see what you mean. Mm-hmm. Hmm. So, you\\u2019ll write me? Well, I already have. You wrote me a letter? Yeah. What\\u2019s it say? Well, you\\u2019ll have to wait and find out. [chuckles] Well, when will that be? Mmm. When I ship out. I\\u2019d say two or three weeks. I\\u2019m gonna miss you every second. [captain 2] All right, all right. Gentlemen, a toast. Buck, Marge\\u2026 hey, you lovebirds\\u2026 we\\u2019re toasting Bucky over here. [patron 1] Hear, hear, Major Egan. To our new Air Exec, Bucky. [patron 1] Hey, hey. [patron 2] All right, Major. [captain 1] Of all the drunks in the 100th. Well, someone\\u2019s got to make a nest for the rest of you dodos. Cheers, Major. [patron 1] To the 100th. [patron 3] Yeah, to the 100th. [patron 4] Best of luck, sir. [sighs] Thanks. [captain 2] Save some Krauts for us. We\\u2019re going to Slooter\\u2019s. You guys coming? Nah, I-I gotta fly early. [captain 2] Buck? I don\\u2019t think so, boys. See you tomorrow then. Bye, Marge. Bucky, see you in England. And remember, I want extra blankets and a cot with a view. [groans] Consider it done. He won\\u2019t tell me. What\\u2019s with the nicknames? [chuckles] [friend] Spill, Marge. Yeah? Go ahead. Go ahead. Okay. [Bucky] Told you, it\\u2019s a long story. Well, they met in basic training before the war started. John, uh\\u2026 John was always Bucky since he was a kid. Right? That\\u2019s right, yeah. And Gale\\u2026 Well, Gale\\u2019s always been Gale. Until\\u2026 First day of basic training, this fella walks up to me and says that I remind him of a guy back home in, uh, Wisconsin, goes by the name of Buck. I tell him my name\\u2019s Gale, Gale Cleven. [both chuckle] And, uh\\u2026 But Bucky here, he\\u2019s not deterred. No, sir. It\\u2019s, uh\\u2026 It\\u2019s just \\u201cBuck this, Buck that.\\u201d \\u201cBuck, can you help me tie my shoes?\\u201d \\u201cBuck, help me fly this plane.\\u201d [chuckles] Before I know it, the whole damn Eighth Air Force is calling me Buck. So\\u2026 What kind of a name is Gale anyway? Oh. [gasps] [Bucky] You know what? You\\u2026 You know what? You should actually be thanking me. I did you a favor. For giving me the same name as you? It\\u2019s not exactly the same name, and it\\u2019s not my fault you look exactly like Buck from Manitowoc, Wisconsin. From Manitowoc. What kind of man does that to his best friend? Aw, it\\u2019s so sweet. [chuckles] Mmm. We need music. Okay. Don\\u2019t go away, Gale\\u2026 Mmm. Buck. You\\u2019re gonna dance with me before this night is through. Oh, don\\u2019t make me dance, Marge. [chuckles, kisses] [Bucky] Pick a good one. Mmm. Artie Shaw, Benny Goodman. [Marge laughs] Hey. You know, I am amazed that we\\u2019re friends. You don\\u2019t like to dance with a beautiful woman. You don\\u2019t drink. You don\\u2019t gamble. You don\\u2019t even like sports. Well, we are one of life\\u2019s great mysteries. [scoffs] [Marge chuckling] [\\u201cBegin the Beguine\\u201d playing] [chuckling] Oh, I love that. Yes. [friend] Yeah? [Marge chuckles] [sighs] Hmm. So this is it. [sighs] This is it. I\\u2019ll see you in a few weeks. If I don\\u2019t die first. Hate to break it to you, Bucky, but you are the 100th\\u2019s Air Executive now. You\\u2019re not going over there to fly missions. Look, I, uh\\u2026 I had a conversation with the CO over at the 389th, and I\\u2019m flying with those boys until you guys show up. I\\u2019ll be an observation pilot. You son of a bitch. Mm-hmm, yeah. Well, someone\\u2019s gotta taste a little combat, tell you what it\\u2019s really like up there. Well, don\\u2019t you die on me before I get over there. Don\\u2019t count on it. [Bucky] Keep your nose down! Let\\u2019s get this fire out! [pilot] Come on, faster! You have to help us! That\\u2019s it! The fire is out! Pull! Pull up! Up! [pilot shouting] Harder! [grunting, shouting] [pilot] Okay, leveling out! Almost there! [Bucky grunts] Fighters, 12:00! Dead ahead! [pilot] Oh, shit! We\\u2019ve lost the fourth flap. Pilot to navigator. We gotta head back. We need a new heading! Fuck! This is Duval. [grunting] And I\\u2019ve been hit. [Bucky] I\\u2019m coming down to you, Duval. Point it due west. Roger! We\\u2019re losing oil pressure on engine two! [Bucky] Keep it steady and I\\u2019ll get a new heading. [breathing shakily] Breathe, man! Just breathe! Hang on! [Duval grunting] Duval! Where are you hit? [shouts] Ah, fuck. Stay with me, Duval! [grunting] I\\u2019m right here. I\\u2019m not gonna make it, Bucky. [shouts] Stop it, Duval. You\\u2019re gonna make it. [grunts] Put your hand on the wound. [mumbles] Here. That\\u2019s good. [Duval] Okay. Okay. All right? Stay with me, goddamn it! [breathing heavily, shouts] You hear me? Look at me! Open your eyes! Open your eyes! Breathe, breathe, breathe! [breathing heavily, grunts] [pilot] Fighters, 12:00! [sergeant] Got one! [pilot] Egan, I need that heading! [Bucky] New heading: Turn left at 248. Roger! Come on. Stay with me. [Duval grunts] [Bucky] We\\u2019re headed home. Yeah. Yeah. Just keep breathing! [panting] [choking, gasping] That was a hell of an observation mission, Major. Are they all like that? You wondering what to tell your guys? Don\\u2019t say anything. They\\u2019ll figure it out. We all do. [airplanes passing] [crew member] The 100th bomb group was sent to England in the spring of 1943 to join the US Army\\u2019s Eighth Air Force in its battle against Nazi Germany. [lieutenant] I say we call this fort Alice From Dallas. Alice From Dallas? It\\u2019s got a ring to it. Alice From Dallas. Alice, our palace. Show Major Cleven. Lorch, show the major. I want her back. Hell of a dame. She\\u2019ll give this fort a little extra muscle. Oh. [chuckles] I see why you\\u2019d wanna name this fort after her. Aw, she\\u2019s special. She\\u2019s formidable. Amison, you sure you got us to the right fjord? Roger. 100%. [lieutenant] Nutting, how we looking back there? Eight in a line, sir. [lieutenant] Roger. [crew member] Most of us had never traveled far from home, let alone flown in an airplane. We came from every corner of the country, with a common purpose: to bring the war to Hitler\\u2019s doorstep. [Buck] Pilot to crew. We\\u2019ll be touching down in Greenland shortly to get some chow and some rest. Blondie Tower, Army 233. A flight of B-17s over Bluie West One. Landing instructions, please. [landing officer] Army 233, flight Blondie Tower. Continue for runway six. Clear to land. Sky CAVU. Winds 330 at 40, gusting to 50. Altimeter 2-niner-niner-0. It\\u2019s a little breezy. Breezy? In \\u2018Bama, we call that a hurricane. Roger, Blondie Tower. Continuing to runway six. Sky CAVU. Winds of 330 to 40, gusting to 50. [landing officer] Hell of a crosswind. Gusts increasing, fellas. Be careful. You might want to circle around, Major. Welcome to Greenland. Landing gear down. Get ready on flaps. [lieutenant] Landing gear coming down. It\\u2019s gonna get bumpy. Hang on, guys. [Buck] Pilot to crew. Prepare for landing. Left gear down. [grunts] Right\\u2019s down. Final-approach checks. Flaps at quarter? Yeah. Flaps at quarter. [grunting] Flaps at half. [lieutenant] Flaps are half. [crew members grunting] Flaps up. Got \\u2019em. [Buck] You gotta pull up, Veal. Come back around. [crew member] Our unit was made up of four squadrons. Major Gale Cleven was the commander of the 350th. He and Major Egan were the unquestioned leaders of our entire group. Ev Blakely was a pilot from Seattle. Look who it is. Blakely. [crew member] And big-hearted Benny DeMarco, from Philly. Major. DeMarco. Hell of a landing. Seen worse. Is that the fight? [Amison] Yeah. Claytor, you got money on this, right? I do. It\\u2019s bad signal though, man. Yeah, you don\\u2019t say. Well, turn it up. [crew member] Bombardiers James Douglass and Howard Hamilton were from the Midwest. Hambone. Major. Yep. [Claytor] Calm down. I got it. [crew member] And Charles Cruikshank, also known as Crank, was from New England. Hiya, Crank. Heard you boys had a rough landing. [crew member] My best friend Joe \\u201cBubbles\\u201d Payne and I were navigators, so location was important to us. Uh, Major? Lieutenant Crosby. Uh, where are you from? Yeah, we gotta put a pin in it. Bubbles and I\\u2026 we\\u2019re, yeah, you know, keeping the tradition alive. Got guys from all parts. Yeah. [chuckles] Ah. Casper, Wyoming. Cowboy State, huh? [chuckles] [Buck] Yep. Well, it looks like you\\u2019re the first, Major. How about that. [officers cheering, chattering] Major. What can I get for ya? A buddy of mine came through here some weeks ago. Group Air Exec. Uh, there was an incident. You friends with Egan? Major John Egan? Bucky? I am. Yeah. Whatever he said, I didn\\u2019t do anything wrong. No, he\\u2026 he just wanted me to give you this. Said it\\u2019s a replacement. A replacement? Yeah. [scoffs, sighs] [scoffs] And how exactly is this supposed to be a replacement? Sergeant, I don\\u2019t know what went on, but he told me that that should make up for it. You see that? Broken narwhal tusk? He pulled it down off the wall, pretended to be a unicorn. Ripped two of my couches, broke almost every glass in the bar. I see. You know, usually I can spot a troublemaker, but your friend seemed fine. Till he started to sing. Yeah, that sounds about right. \\u266a I asked her for credit She answered me nay \\u266a \\u266a Such a customer as you I can have any day \\u266a \\u266a And it\\u2019s no, nay, never \\u266a You don\\u2019t have to do this. It\\u2019s a stupid bet. \\u266a No, nay, never, no more \\u266a I have to now. \\u266a Will I play\\u2026 \\u266a [patron 1] Who\\u2019s it gonna be? All right, all right. [patron 1] Who\\u2019s it gonna be? [shushing] Now, I\\u2019ve played every one of ya\\u2026 [clears throat] \\u2026and you Irish are about as good at hitting that bull\\u2019s-eye as you are at hammering your nails. [patrons clamoring, laughing] I don\\u2019t know why you\\u2019re laughing. You English ain\\u2019t much better. Jack! But Tommy here, Tommy here is the best damn dart slinger in the whole of East Anglia! You\\u2019ll lose an eye. No, I won\\u2019t. I trust Tommy. [sighs] Now, he wins this, I get both those bikes. Yeah. You\\u2019re on, Yank. [Bucky] Both of \\u2019em. [patron 2] All right, both of them. And I get a kiss. All right, Tommy. Not my eyes. Not my eyes, Tommy. All right? [breathing deeply] [patron 3] Come on, Tommy. [breathing deeply] Whoo! All right, Tommy. Whenever you\\u2019re ready. [patrons cheering, laughing] [shouting] I just lost two bloody bikes, Tommy. What\\u2019s the matter with you? Tommy! [laughing] \\u266a Nothing but blue skies Do I see \\u266a \\u266a Not in England though Got shitty weather and blue skies \\u266a \\u266a Smiling at me \\u266a Evening, Major. Is that bike for sale? Not for all the money in the world. [Crosby] It was my job to get Captain Brady and the rest of our crew from Greenland to our base at Thorpe Abbotts in England. But somehow, we were separated from the rest of our group in the clouds over the Atlantic. Tough enough with zero visibility, but I had another problem: uncontrollable air sickness. [vomiting] [Brady] We have an electrical problem. We need a heading. Crosby, you there? Sorry. Could you repeat that? We got a gremlin in the electrical. Give us a holding pattern while we figure this out, Croz. Roger. Stand by. Turn right to 165. Over. [Brady] Roger. Turning right to 165. Shutting off electrical and recycling it. Let\\u2019s fix this. It\\u2019s gotta be one of the control circuits. I\\u2019ll pull the fuses. That\\u2019ll isolate the problem. Right. Go. [Hambone] How are you still vomiting? Your stomach\\u2019s gotta be as empty as our fuel tank. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. [laughs] [gasps] [Hambone] Ugh! Oh, gosh darn it, Croz. I\\u2019m sorry. It\\u2019s all over me. Get me a rag. I\\u2019m sorry, I\\u2019m sorry, I\\u2019m sorry. Come on. It stinks. [Brady] Come on. You got it? No gremlin as far as I can see. Maybe a problem with the wheel motor. [Brady] Restarting batteries and generators. [flips switch] Back on. Warning lights off. Is that the coast of England? Crosby, that\\u2019s England, right? Uh. No, we\\u2026 we shouldn\\u2019t be over water, Lieutenant. Sir, what\\u2019s your heading? 165, like you told me. Oh, good Lord in Heaven. Son of a bitch. That\\u2019s France! [explosions] Pilot to crew, flak ahead. Hold on. Shit! Goddamn it, Croz. [exhales sharply] [belches] [people chattering] [horn honks] [Bucky] Morris. Thanks for the bikes. I\\u2019ll get you next time. [laughs] Come on. [clicks tongue] There you go, lovely. Keep that way. Ooh, oh. Go on, girl. Here they come. [chattering] [children laughing] Come on, boy. DeMarco! Hey, Major. [Bucky] Where did you get that dog, Benny? I won him at craps. You took this baby above 10,000 feet. He\\u2019s got a mask. It cost me three bucks. But boy, he loves to fly. He wouldn\\u2019t stop howling. That\\u2019s because he\\u2019s part wolf. [chuckles] That wolf\\u2019s part dog. Got a name? Meatball. Welcome to the 100th, Meatball. Come on, Meatball. You miss me? Like a stone in my shoe. [laughs] How you been getting on? Uh, half our equipment\\u2019s yet to show up. Had to borrow masks and parachutes from the Brits. Air Exec ought to take care of that. My opinion: They ought to can the guy. Also, get used to the mud. Hey, listen, your, uh\\u2026 your radio guy pick up any chatter from the 418th? We\\u2019re missing Brady. Negative. Oh, I got you a bike. I need a bike? Or it\\u2019s a 20-minute walk from the quarters to the mess. And these things are sold out for weeks. I figure you\\u2019ll buzz past a bunch of guys crawling through the rain on the way to dinner. You\\u2019ll come around and say, \\u201cThank you, Bucky.\\u201d Don\\u2019t count on it. Well, there\\u2019s Brady. Okay, let\\u2019s check the landing gear. Bring it down. Roger. Left coming down. Tail down. Negative on right. Fuck. Right wheel won\\u2019t come down. Blum, get on the manual crank. [Blum] I\\u2019m on it. Hafer, you help him out. Roger, wilco. Take that. Where\\u2019s the crank? Come on. [grunts] [grunting] [Blum grunting] It won\\u2019t budge. Come on. [Blum] I\\u2019m trying. Come on. Get out of the way. Come on. Give it here. You got it? Yeah. [grunting] The landing gear motor must be fried or the jackscrew\\u2019s jammed up. You sure? [Blum] Yes, sir. [groans] It\\u2019s completely frozen. It\\u2019s not coming down. Bring the left landing gear up. You sure? Yeah, we got a better shot at walking away from a belly landing than we do on one wheel. Clear-up Tower, this is Army 071. Landing gear not responding. Requesting landing instructions. Over. [tower operator] Roger, Army 071, clear to land. Rescue crew at the ready. Over. [copilot] Roger, Clear-up. [Brady] Pilot to crew, prepare for crash landing. [Hafer] You hear that? Come on. Let\\u2019s go. Let\\u2019s go. [announcer] 247. Emergency personnel\\u2026 [soldiers clamoring, shouting] [grunting] [grunts] [breathes heavily] Okay. Get out! Everybody out. [Blum] Let\\u2019s go, go, go! Get the fuck out of here! Move! Move! Go, go, go, go. [siren blaring] Go, go! Come on! Get a move on. Run now or you\\u2019re dead. Go, go! [sirens continue] [emergency worker] All clear. [panting] Oh, fuck. Easy deal. Jack it up and hook it up. I\\u2019m on it. Let\\u2019s go. You\\u2019re a navigator, Crosby. You should be able to, I don\\u2019t know, find England. Everyone okay? Yes, sir. Sir. Brady. Step into my office. How\\u2019d you lose the rest of the squadron? We, uh\\u2026 We got separated in clouds. And, um, then we had some kind of electrical failure, so we spent an hour just trying to get the wheel down. Well, you know what they say. There are two kinds of pilots, those who have had a wheels-up landing and those who will. Major, it looks worse than it is. [Bucky] All right. Sort it out. [crew member 2] On it, Major. You didn\\u2019t have to cover for me, okay. It was my responsibility. I should\\u2019ve\\u2026 I wasn\\u2019t covering for you. We had a mechanical failure. Get a grip on that airsickness. Or get off my plane. [softly] Yes, sir. Croz, you take the scenic route? So, you wanna tell me about this unicorn story? Well, the unicorn is my favorite extinct animal. France? How the hell did you manage that? How else, Bubbles? [stammers] Puking my goddamn guts out. I thought that went away once you got going. [Crosby] No, yeah, it usually does. But this time with the turbulence, it kinda\\u2026 [stammers] \\u2026I don\\u2019t know. [sighs] This time it didn\\u2019t. [grunting] I gotta be the worst navigator in the entire Army Air Force. [grunts] Oh, Crosby, there\\u2019s gotta be somebody worse. [Bucky] Whoa. Hey. [Bubbles] At least one. Wrong side of the road, Lieutenant. [Crosby] Sir. [Bucky] Welcome to England. Now, you ask me, those two have watched Test Pilot a few too many times. You watched Test Pilot a few too many times. Yeah. [sighs] Didn\\u2019t help. Well, at least we get to tell \\u2019em which direction to point the plane. [Bucky] See ya, Buck. [Buck] Thanks for the lift. Normally the direct route. In your case, the scenic route. [Crosby] Oh, the scenic route? Oh, very funny. I wouldn\\u2019t have assumed I\\u2019d need to explain to you the gravity of your responsibilities. You are aware this isn\\u2019t just about how well your crews make their beds. I am, sir. Which is why I prioritize the flying more than their folding. You are in charge of 35 planes and 350 aircrewmen. Boys who have yet to experience combat. Their lives depend on order and discipline and your example. Yes, sir. [sighs] With all due respect\\u2026 I think I would be of more use to them and you as a squadron commander, rather than an Air Exec. Just because you spin the baton at the front doesn\\u2019t make you the band leader. I just don\\u2019t think I was made to sit behind a desk. I need to be up there helping my guys. Colonel LeMay has us in his sights. And he\\u2019s just itching to pull the trigger on the 100th Bomb Group. That\\u2019s not gonna happen on my watch. And I expect all officers to get in the game with me. That means you, Major Egan. You\\u2019re dismissed. [sighs] [retches] [groans] [breathing heavily] [guard] You okay, sir? Should I call the doctor? I\\u2019m all right. [breathes heavily] [Crosby] Within days, they woke us up for our first mission. With hundreds of hours of flight training in the States, we had to believe we were prepared. We had to, because now it was real. [soldier] Sir. Sir, you\\u2019re flying today. Major Cleven, sir. [Crosby] There was always a special breakfast on mission days: eggs, French toast, flapjacks, double rations of bacon, fresh grapefruit juice and a couple of cups of GI coffee. The men would come to call it the last supper. I hope we all we get back okay from\\u2026 Chuck, can you pass the salt, please? Uh-oh. [soldier] Oh, shit. He spilled the salt. [chuckles] Would you please toss the salt over your shoulder, so we can all get on with our breakfast? [shaker shatters] [soldier 2] Who did that? [soldier 3] Jesus. Not the whole thing, Chuck. [soldier 4] Doesn\\u2019t bring us bad luck. You said toss the salt. [soldier 2] Moron. He said toss the salt. Curt, I\\u2019m flying with you today. [DeMarco] Here you go. You\\u2019re what? Sorry, Dick. I know that puts you in the tail, but at least you\\u2019ll be able to shoot back. It\\u2019s all right. Is Meatball saddling up? Lemmons or Wink will watch him. You don\\u2019t wanna go on this one, buddy. I promise you. Well, I better get some of those eggs before they\\u2019re all gone. No, don\\u2019t bother, Buck. These eggs were hatched and powdered before my balls dropped. [chuckles] All right. I\\u2019ll pass on the eggs then. Morning, boys. [soldiers] Major Veal. Morning, sir. How\\u2019d you sleep? [sighs] Fucking great. Like a fucking baby. The new CO flying with us? The new CO, or the new, new CO? [soldiers laughing] Don\\u2019t worry about the CO. Worry about your flying. I want formation so damn tight you wouldn\\u2019t be able to slip a dime through our wingtips. [soldier 5] Yes, sir, Major Veal. [soldier 6] Yes, sir. Ah-ten-hut. [colonel] As you were. The target for today is Bremen. [soldiers clamor, laugh, whistle] We\\u2019ll be hitting the U-boat pens on the Weser River. Now, I cannot stress enough the importance of this target. We lost almost 70 cargo ships to U-boats last month alone. And if we can\\u2019t get material from the United States to Great Britain, we won\\u2019t be stepping foot on the continent. The 350th will be in high position with Major Cleven as lead pilot, and the 349th will be low with Major Veal as lead. I\\u2019ll be up front with Lieutenant Dye in the 351st. After formation, the 100th will join the 94th, the 95th, and the 96th bomber groups. We will be in the low-low. [soldiers sigh, whisper] Tail-end Charlie. [colonel] In a total wing strength of 78 heavy bombers. Fuck. Major Bowman, our Intelligence Officer, will take it from here. And Captain Becker will finish up with the weather. Major. [Bowman] Thank you, sir. Lights, please. [colonel] There you go. Note both naval and ground-based flak positions along the Frisian Islands, from Norderney to Langeoog. Over the mainland, you can expect concentrated flak from Wilhelmshaven, all the way down to Bremen. Identified batteries consist of 88 and 105 millimeter guns guided by W\\u00fcrzburg radar, so they will be tracking you. Navigators, bombardiers, once we\\u2019ve wrapped up here, be sure to report to HQ for a specialized briefing. Now, your IP is on the northwest side of Bremen, here. Target map, please. From that initial point, it\\u2019s a straight nine-mile run to the target. These are the pens on the east side of the river. Now, this central pen here will be your mean point of impact. And your heading on to the run-up will be 218 degrees true. Immediately after the turn, follow the river. Here you go, Major. Thank you. [Dick] Come on, Curt. [sighs] What\\u2019s your quote for the day? I\\u2019m gonna fly like an angel today, and not die like one. [chattering] Major, I think it\\u2019s too small. I can\\u2019t get it on. Thanks. There you go. Buck, give me a hand with this sheepskin. Yeah. [crew member 3] You good? You got this. We got this. I like your aftershave. Good. This is how close I want you on my wing today. Just like we trained for. Yes, sir. [person] Good morning, gentlemen. For those who don\\u2019t know me, I\\u2019m Father Teska. I\\u2019m right across the way\\u2026 Captain Phillips too, if anyone needs us. Thank you, Padre. We\\u2019ll be sure to keep that in mind. Mmm. [Bucky] Buck. Hey. You all right? [Buck] Yeah. What\\u2019s this? You settling accounts? It\\u2019s my lucky deuce. Your lucky\\u2026 Jesus, John. Here. Take it. I\\u2019ve gone on two missions with it already. I had two wheels down. Look, two corners bitten off. One for each mission. Here I am. Take it. [Curt] Get on in here. For luck. All right. [blowing kisses] See you later. [blows kisses] All right. See you all later. That\\u2019s where I\\u2019m going. Let\\u2019s circle up. As you know, it\\u2019s our first mission here. I trust you all to remember your training and know your jobs. Let\\u2019s knock one off, and drop bombs on those Nazi fucks, and we get to go home early. [crew] Yes, sir! Major here is gonna be flying with us. Major? First time in the sawmill, boys. Let\\u2019s rack \\u2019em up and knock \\u2019em down. [crew] Yes, sir. All right. Why are we still standing here then? [Buck] Everything okay back here, Dickie? Are you kidding? It\\u2019s cozy as a suite at the Ritz. [chuckles] Thank you. [sniffs, sighs] Gentlemen. Sir. We\\u2019re blessed to have you on our plane, sir. I feel the spirit of God in you. Yeah, in all of us, pal. You saved my seat. Yeah. Rather offer it to you than have you sit on my lap till I move. Ready for the checklist. [Curt] Form 1A? Check. Fuel transfer valves and switches? Both transfer valves are off and switch is off. Intercoolers are cold. Gyros? [lieutenant] Fuel shutoff switches? All four open. Cowl flaps? Open left and locked. Throttles? Throttles are closed. Master and ignition switches? Batteries on. And check. Booster pumps, pressure? [Dye] Pumps on. Fuel quantity, good. All right, Lieutenant, you ready to start engines? Yes, sir. Start one. Good to have you with us, Colonel. [engine starts] [Curt] Start two. Start two. Fuel pressure, oil pressure looking good. Start three. [Crosby] The B-17 had 12 machine guns protecting us from every side. We called it the Flying Fortress. But the key to our survival was sticking together, creating a combat box of defensive fire from a tight formation. It was important because if we got separated, the German fighters could pick us off one by one. [soldiers cheering] Give \\u2019em hell, boys! [cheering continues] Show \\u2019em green. [colonel] Here we go, fellas. [engine rumbling] Sixty. Ninety. 100. 110. Okay, boys. Here we go. [engine rumbling] [Curt] Forty. Fifty. Sixty. [cheering] Ninety. 100, 110. [Buck] Still climbing, boys. Three hours before we hit the target. After-takeoff checklist. Climb power is set. Cowl flaps are good. Right gear is up. [Buck] Left gear\\u2019s up. [sergeant] Tail wheel up. Okay, Bosser, let\\u2019s get you in the hole. [Buck] Okay, Curt, I got control. Pilot to crew. 10,000 feet. Masks on and check in. [Bosser] Ball turret, roger. Tail, roger. Right waist, roger. Left waist, okay. Radio, roger. [sergeant] Engineer, roger. Navigator, okay. Bombardier, roger. Best, pop a flare. Let\\u2019s see if we can get into formation in this soup. [Best] Roger that. Is that a flare? Nose to crew, I think I saw a flare right below us. Copy. You see who it came from? Negative. I can\\u2019t see a thing out there. Holy shit! B-17 12:00 low. They\\u2019re right below us. [copilot] Roy, pull up! Damn it! There\\u2019s a fort on top of us. Roger. I see him. [Claytor] Tail gunner, talk to me back there. Goddamn it, are we clear? Tail to pilot, we\\u2019re clear. [copilot] Jesus. That was close. [Claytor] That\\u2019s Cleven\\u2019s fort. I\\u2019d know that aftershave anywhere. [copilot] Are you serious? [Curt] I mean, you told him to stay close. [Buck] Not like that. Pilot to crew, we got another hour climbing through this muck. Keep your eyes peeled. [Veal] Christ. We need to catch up to the rest of the group. We\\u2019re way behind. Formation\\u2019s a mess. [rattling] [lieutenant] Engine one running rough. We\\u2019re losing it. [Veal] Shit. [Buck] Pilot to tail gunner. What can you see back there? Tail to Cleven, from our group we\\u2019ve got six in formation. The 351st is lined up but the 349th is way back. All six of \\u2019em. Looks like their lead, Veal, is trailing smoke. Roger. Redmeat Lead, this is Surface lead. What\\u2019s going on back there, Veal? [Veal] Surface Lead, having engine problems. Working on it. Roger. You need to make a decision, Veal. You\\u2019re putting your squadron in jeopardy. Pacer Lead, roger. [rattling] [lieutenant] Sir, we\\u2019re miles behind the group. The longer we wait, the longer it\\u2019ll take for them to catch up. [huffs] Goddamn it. Shut it down. Cutting fuel. [engine 1 stops] Feather that prop. Pacer Lead, this is Redmeat Lead. We\\u2019ve lost engine one. Can\\u2019t maintain this pace. We\\u2019re headed back. Copy, Surface Lead. [Veal] Redmeat Deputy, we have mechanical failure. I\\u2019m heading back. Lead is all yours. [colonel] Roger, wilco. Pilot to crew, we\\u2019re taking Redmeat Lead position. Go to maximum continuous power. Monitor our consumption. We\\u2019re gonna burn a lot of fuel catching up with the rest of the group. [siren blaring] [soldiers panting] [siren continues] [speaking German] [speaking German] Fire! Fire! Fire! Here we go. Flak incoming. Hold on, boys. [Bosser] Ball to crew, flak, 11:00 low. Flak 10:00 high. Four o\\u2019clock high. [Best] Flak, everywhere. May God rebuke him, we humbly pray.

Peter: Figure it out, yeah. Liz: What? What? \\u2026 Ask the question. (sighs) Peter: What happened the last case you worked with Navarro? The Wheeler case\\u2026 \\u2019cause that was it for you guys, right? Liz: Alright. Only one bedtime story. It was a murder-suicide. William Wheeler. He was a bad, bad motherfucker. Sexual assault\\u2026 armed robbery, assault and battery. He was in and out a bunch. The last time he came out, he took up with an 18-year-old girl. He beat her, hard. Sent her to the hospital\\u2026 twice. Broken arm\\u2026 smashed jaw\\u2026 some other things.

That came out in May 2016. And Leah played it all the time. Her birthday. (sighs) Drove me nuts. And, um, alright, look at this. Here her hair\\u2019s changing color.

Evangeline: (sighs) Nobody. Liz: Alright. Look at this. Everything else is selfie or timed. Evangeline: That\\u2019s a candid photo. Somebody was there with them that day. There has to be more like this one. (light music playing) Liz: Yep. \\u2026 See that? Ya think that\\u2019s her hair dye? It\\u2019s not a print. Evangeline: Yeah, we don\\u2019t need a print. (\\u201cLike I Do\\u201d by Georgina Birch playing over speakers) (doorbell chimes) Susan: Hey, I\\u2019m gonna be another 20! (police radio chatter) \\u266a Ooh, ooh \\u266a \\u266a No one loves you like I do \\u266a Evangeline: Hi, Susan. \\u266a Ooh, ooh \\u266a \\u266a No one loves you like I do \\u266a Evangeline: What was that color you used on Annie\\u2019s hair? (chuckles) Evangeline: Ah, right here. \\u266a Evangeline: Electric Blue, wasn\\u2019t it? You lied to me. Susan: Yeah, I knew Ray. Evangeline: And you just decided not to tell me. Your friend was dead. Susan: Yeah\\u2026 32 stabs. It\\u2019s a pretty clear message. Child: Mommy? (whimpers) Liz: Mac and cheese. You got any mac and cheese? Susan: Uh, yeah. It\\u2019s in the, uh\\u2013 Liz: Yeah, I\\u2019ll find it. Hey, do you know what the name of that unicorn is on your sweater? That\\u2019s Puddles. That\\u2019s what they called her \\u2019cause she cried a lot. All the mean unicorns called her that but she was just super hungry. Come on. Susan: It\\u2019s okay. Liz: We\\u2019re gonna go make some mac and cheese. Does that sound good? Child: Yeah. Liz: I\\u2019ma tell you all about Puddles. All her story about how she cooks mac and cheese. Here, sit down on this. Child: Okay. Evangeline: You need to start talkin\\u2019. Susan: (deep breath) I went to Tsalal to give haircuts to the men there. Annie came with me one time. Once. I didn\\u2019t wanna bring her. Sh-She wouldn\\u2019t take a no. She was, like, obsessed with coming. So, fuck it, I could use the company. Evangeline: And what happened that one time? Susan; Annie and Ray hit it off. They talked all night. She showed him her tattoo. He was, like, fixated on it. (light music playing) Evangeline: This one? Susan: Yeah, that\\u2019s it. Evangeline: Do you know what it means? Susan: She dreamt it. We were in high school. A buncha times. She got the tattoo, the dreams stopped. Liz: Alright. Stir, stir, stir. And then, all the unicorns went skating on the lake that Puddles had made with her rainbow tears. Woman; Ugh, I love skating. Susan: I thought it was gonna be a one-night thing. Pretty soon, they were hangin\\u2019 out all the time. Evangeline: And what about Clark? Was he\\u2026 violent? Anything to make you think he might do something? Susan: No. He was, he was quiet. He was-I mean, he was a little weird, but\\u2026 he was crazy about her. But Annie changed when they started goin\\u2019 out. Evangeline: Changed how? Susan: She didn\\u2019t want anybody to know they were together. And that was weird. Evangeline: You could\\u2019ve told me back then. I would\\u2019ve protected you. Susan: I was terrified. Plus, I was seeing a guy from Tsalal. Liz: Wait\\u2026 who? Susan: Oliver Tagaq. Liz: Oh, there-there\\u2019s, there\\u2019s no Oliver that works at Tsalal. Susan: He was the equipment engineer. He left right before Annie died. Liz: Um\\u2026 and, um\\u2026 do you know where we could find this Oliver? Susan: Last I heard, somewhere out on the ice. Probably hunting. I don\\u2019t think he\\u2019s lookin\\u2019 to be found. (deep breath) After they found her, I did call the police. I just didn\\u2019t wanna talk to you \\u2019cause you\\u2019da known me. So, I didn\\u2019t leave my name. But I told \\u2019em about Clark. Evangeline: Who\\u2019d you talk to? Liz: Prior, where\\u2019s your dad? Over. Peter (over radio): He\\u2019s still out in the search, Chief. Evangeline: There\\u2019s plenty of radio signal out there, he\\u2019s hidin\\u2019 his ass. Peter: I\\u2019ll get him to call the minute he gets back. Liz: Yeah, okay, you do that, and, um, see if you can find an Oliver Tagaq. He was an engineer six years ago at Tsalal. Got that? Peter: On it, over. Evangeline: That son of a bitch takes me off the case, and then he buries this lead? Liz: Question is, why is Hank fuckin\\u2019 around\\u2013 Evangeline: Don\\u2019t \\u201cAsk the question\\u201d me! Okay? I\\u2019ll tell you why he did it right now. It\\u2019s the fucking mine behind it. You know I\\u2019m right. Liz: I don\\u2019t know shit. Evangeline: Well, then you\\u2019re a shit detective. Liz: Yeah, well, whatever. Whatever you say. Evangeline: Annie protests against the mine, Annie gets murdered, the police shush it all, do the fucking math. Liz: You do the fuckin\\u2019 math. Evangeline: (sighs) Liz: Alright, without the mine, there\\u2019s no town. 50% of the population works for it, which means half the people who live here have got a reason to silence Annie K. And what about Clark, creepy boyfriend? What, you think the mine\\u2019s responsible for him too? According to your conspiracy theory, Tsalal and Clark had nothin\\u2019 to do with it. Is that it?

I-I think they died before they froze. Liz: What? Vince: I-I mean, they didn\\u2019t freeze to death. I\\u2019ve seen plenty of frozen animals, and cold makes their heart rate drop, their breath grows shallow. They basically fall asleep. All told, a pretty peaceful death. Those guys, this\\u2026 this is not how you die in the cold. It\\u2019s just not. Liz: What killed \\u2019em? Vince: It\\u2019s hard to tell without a chance to properly postmortem them, but looks like cardiac arrest if I had to put money on it. Liz: Oh, well, how can you be sure? Vince: I can\\u2019t. I\\u2019m just a vet, ma\\u2019am. But I\\u2019ve seen caribous die of plain fright. Running, terrified. Uh, these scientists, they, they, uh, they look the same.

Liz: Uh\\u2026 I hear ya. So, if I go in the state records\\u2026 this property is your land? It\\u2019s under your name, Mr. Tagaq? Oliver: You wanna come and see the deed, lady? You.

Doctor? Let\\u2019s go. [Door slams shut] Terribly sad. Outside of the antique, I barely got you for St. Valentine\\u2019s or whatever. Do you still possess a working pistol? Anyone who wants to shoot me will have to bring their own gun. I have no idea what that means, but it has the ring of your usual moral foolishness. Still, there\\u2019s a madman running around. You might want to protect yourself with something more reliable than just your wits. [Slow jazz music] [Engine revving] [Liquid pouring] [Glass clinks] [Clock ticking] [Speaking French] Is it true? The sisters? All of them? [Clock ticking] Where\\u2019s Teresa? [Speaking French] I prepared the blue room for her. Let the poor thing sleep. Whatever you need from her will wait.

How did your meeting at the bank go? In order to get a loan, I would need to have almost as much as I want to borrow. [Speaking French] Why don\\u2019t you ask Sam? [Speaking French] Don\\u2019t start. [Speaking French] You wore the necklace. [Speaking French] Fuck luck. Always. [Speaking French] Or forget the bank and sell it?

[Knocking] [Ominous music] Have you seen Teresa? [Speaking French] This morning? No. Is she not in the bedroom? No. [Speaking French] Well, she couldn\\u2019t have gone far. Not on foot. She could have. If she left last night. Or if someone came and took her. [Slow string music] [Engine revving] [Breaks squealing] Cheeky little automobile, Mr. Spade. Out to enjoy some of that fresh country air, are we? Something like that. Ah, both you and the girl. You saw her? Yes. At dawn, I was on my way here. The colors at sunrise are a painter\\u2019s dream. She was on the road? She came past me. Her shoes were muddy. As if she\\u2019d been running. And her eyes, they were downcast. Seemingly upset. What color were they? I think they were\\u2026 Ah, yes. Sorry, a bit obsessed with details. Occupational hazard, I\\u2019m afraid. Yeah, you said she was upset? Yes, well, I imagine the massacre at the manor was the cause. Oh, you heard about that, huh? Everyone\\u2019s heard about that. From the girl? No, I waved. Tried to chat with her, but she just ignored me. Can\\u2019t say I blame her. Pardon? [Engine revving] [Intense orchestra music] [Distant dog barking] [Car door slams shut] Teresa?

They\\u2019re all dead. What difference did their useless rules make? I\\u2019ll tell you what. You stay and wait for your father to show up, smoke to your lungs\\u2019 content. I\\u2019ll be back at sundown. If you\\u2019re still hanging around, you come home with me. If not, then swell knowing you and I hope you and Philippe have a nice life on the run. [Barn door opening] Shit! [Engine revving] Any idea how she ended up inside the chapel last night? I don\\u2019t play with dolls anymore. So, no idea how she lost her head? I gave her away years ago. You know this car still smells like roses. She\\u2019d bring treats to the orphanage at Christmas. Gabrielle. Oranges from California. Imagine that. Sometimes she\\u2019d bring me books or a blouse, or some other piece of clothing she was done with. The books were all in French. She said that once I started to dream in French, I\\u2019d be fluent. She said the same to me. Sadly for everyone, I still dream in English. Though usually French wins. She didn\\u2019t want me to hate you, for what you did to my father. [Gunshot] Get down. [Tires screeches] [Intense music] [Engine revving] Stay down. [Gunshot] [Tires squeal] You all right? [Motorcycle revving] [Engine revving] [Intense string music] [Motorcycle revs in distance] Mr. Spade? Nasty business. This car\\u2019s cursed. Not the person who shot that window, that\\u2019s for sure. Are you saying they missed on purpose? The car was moving too slowly for the gunman not to have hit me. And what about the second shot? Self-defense. I was about to run him over. Yes, of course you were. I\\u2019m not even sure it was meant for me. George: Ah! Lovely. That\\u2019s great. That\\u2019s my new neighbor. An odd fellow. [Sighs] Philippe could have taken the shot. With Teresa in the car? Hard to imagine even Philippe doing that. And he\\u2019s wounded, which shouldn\\u2019t make him too hard to find for a pair of top detectives like you and\\u2026 [In French] your idiot brother. Samuel, we talked about you using words like \\u201cmoron\\u201d and \\u201cidiot\\u201d when speaking to my brother. Terms of endearment. We\\u2019ve checked the two hospitals in the area. No one with a bullet wound has been admitted. Same goes for veterinarians and dentists. Sounds like you two are right on top of things. [Footsteps] Mr. Spade, can I borrow your lawyer? You were four years old. [Pencil scrawling on paper] [Bike chain winding] Henri: I took her to Le Canard Noir, that old place in Rodez. Set me back 20 francs. I\\u2019ll take care of that. Best 20 francs I ever spent. With that stupid grin, I\\u2019ll assume that you and Mademoiselle Ruse are once again exchanging\\u2026 [In French] the heat of passion. In the General\\u2019s office. On his desk. I hope one of you didn\\u2019t wrinkle Philippe\\u2019s file. Sergeant Saint-Andre\\u2019s file is rather short. On several pages, names, dates, places are blacked out. He\\u2019s army intelligence. I\\u2019m sorry, I couldn\\u2019t get more. That\\u2019s plenty. Philippe, a spy. I guess the war really did deplete the supply of able men. There was something I heard, just a rumor. Well, there\\u2019s this bow near the base, where a lot of ex-Deuxi\\u00e8me Bureau guys hang out. Every so often, I go there for a drink, and the other night, there was some joking about Saint-Andre hiding a young woman in his quarters his last time on base. He\\u2019s probably not the first. The woman was Algerian. No one heard her name. Thank you, Henri. Much appreciated. Any time. I must confess, since I was a child, you\\u2019ve been my hero. Your hero? Oui. My advice, trade up. [Water splashes] [Ominous music] [People talking in the distance] [Romantic Latin music] Woman: You know what they say, \\u201cMarry for money, divorce for love.\\u201d I thought it was, \\u201cmarry for money, earn every nickel.\\u201d Which do you believe? I\\u2019ll get back to you. You forget something, sweetheart? We\\u2019re having a swim, aren\\u2019t we? What will the gardener think? I\\u2019m not worried about the gardener leaving me for someone younger. If I were you, I\\u2019d be more worried about mosquito bites. I\\u2019m not going anywhere. I\\u2019m just reminding you, there\\u2019s more to me than my money. How could I ever forget? [Water splashes] Doctor: Why must the innocent always pay for the rest of us, for our sins? When the Nazis paid their little visit, mother superior ran guns for the underground. Your point? No one\\u2019s innocent. Still, one tries to be on the right side of things. If only one knew what that was. Six dead nuns, five files. Which one is missing? I know these women. I examined them every six months. Three were from Spain, one was from Portugal, and the mother superior was born here. The last was an African. We had not yet met. There\\u2019s no file for her. I met that one briefly. [Coughs] Can I see the bodies? Patrice had them all bagged for transport to Paris. Does Patrice really want Paris crawling up and down his town? He does not, but he understands that six massacred nuns, or dead nuns in any number, bring much unwanted pressure. And Paris is better equipped. The extent of the autopsies I can do run from death from fall off ladder to death from heart attack. Don\\u2019t forget boredom. You joke, but the ministry was quite serious and quite clear in their instruction. I was not to touch the bodies. Of course, they said that after I found this around the neck of the African. [Bell rings] [Envelope rustles] I didn\\u2019t know nuns were allowed to wear jewelry. [Locket clicks] Real nuns, that is. [Suspenseful orchestral music] [Discordant music] [Laughing] [Clock ticking] [Suspenseful piano and orchestral music] [Footsteps approaching] [Door opens] [Gun clatters] [Gun clatters] -[Door thuds and squeaks] [Door slams] We must wait for the replacement windows to come from England. How long? [Dog barking] Who shot you? Technically, I was shot at. Just a second. I care about this car, so whatever your feelings for the late Jacques Laveront, promise me you\\u2019ll take good care of her. I\\u2019ll treat the car as I would any beautiful woman I despise, with respect in her presence and lust in her absence. Good, then we understand each other. I think. Ciao, Anatole.Sam. Just happened to be passing by? No one has been shot or shot at here for a long time. Not since the war. And that was collaborators killing partisans and partisans killing collaborators, not some crazy person executing nuns. There\\u2019s been another war since, in case you\\u2019ve forgotten. And we both know that one\\u2019s made plenty of people crazy and desperate. This is not really about people though. This is about you. There are six dead women who might say otherwise. That was yesterday. Today someone shot at you. But you\\u2019re not worried about me. Could Jean-Pierre have done this? Sure, he could have, but he didn\\u2019t. How do you know? He\\u2019s all talk. But murder, no. Jean-Pierre would disagree. So would every man who went to war. That\\u2019s why they give them medals, with snappy uniforms to pin them on. That way, whenever they look in a mirror, they see a soldier. And what about the man who burns his uniform and sells his medals? What does he see? You may think you understand him, but you make him feel small. You make most men feel small. That\\u2019s because they don\\u2019t know me. Then, I\\u2019ve never much cared what other men thought of me. Not caring doesn\\u2019t make one bulletproof. You should needle point that one on a pillow. Sometimes, Sam\\u2026 [Birds chirping] [Cuckoo cooing] Spade, I\\u2019d like you to meet my mother. Lady Cynthia, Sam Spade. How do you do, Mr. Spade? I\\u2019ve been better. I\\u2019m so sorry for invading your devastatingly attractive home without being asked, but George said he\\u2026 he didn\\u2019t think you\\u2019d mind. I don\\u2019t. Nice to meet you. Oh, Mr. Spade. Um, please feel free to say no, but may I ask you an enormous favor? Sure, you can ask. I\\u2019ve never seen the landscape my husband painted for your late wife. Um, would you mind, terribly, if I came inside with you and took a peek? May I come, too? I\\u2026 I haven\\u2019t laid eyes on that painting since the day of the unveiling. More the merrier. Ah. Ah. George and I have rented the villa next door. Uh, we\\u2019re neighbors. Though, of course, it\\u2019s hardly as scrumptious as all this. Gabrielle\\u2019s family got the house on the cheap. The previous owner died suddenly. Oh. He was guillotined. [Cynthia gasps] In fact, he got his head chopped off right after Marie Antoinette. Oh, dear. Mother, he\\u2019s pulling your leg. Oh, capital. [Laughing] Oh, you\\u2019ll find I\\u2019m extremely gullible, Mr. Spade. Somehow, I doubt that. [Door opens] Oh, thank you. George, look at this marvelous place. Oh, they don\\u2019t make them like this anymore, do they? Ooh, oh, oh. [George and Cynthia sighing and laughing] It\\u2019s just wonderful! Yes, Mother, notice the shadowing. Ah. Ah. Singeon\\u2019s sense of color was always divine. And look, George, look how he\\u2019s captured the\\u2026 the delicate flesh tones of this lovely, naked lady. Well, I\\u2019ll leave you two to show yourselves out. Yes, thank you so much. Awfully kind of you. [clock chimes] Oh, one more thing. I believe we have a mutual friend, Philippe Saint-Andre. I wouldn\\u2019t say that Philippe and I are friends, more like, a long time ago, we bumped into each other. Oh, oh, I\\u2026 I\\u2026 I\\u2026 I see. Well, I\\u2026 I hear he\\u2019s returned to Bazuel. I would love to say hello. I\\u2019m afraid I can\\u2019t help you. I\\u2019ve no idea where he is. Mm, pity. How do you know Philippe? Well, uh, years ago, he purchased one of my husband\\u2019s masterpieces. Really? Mm. He paid a generous sum for it, too. Are you sure we\\u2019re talking about the same Philippe Saint-Andre? The Philippe I know isn\\u2019t one to part with a generous sum, or any kind of sum, for anything that he could just as easily take. [Radio announcer speaking French] [Item thuds] No. [Footsteps retreating] [Birds chirping] Well, this morning, I had to get a ride from Basem to buy two new tires. You had to slash the spare, too? I don\\u2019t know what you\\u2019re talking about. You sound like your mother. That was her favorite answer to every question. \\u201cI don\\u2019t know what you\\u2019re talking about.\\u201d It was like a tick. [Coughs] And that\\u2019s what you get for saying such things about my mother. [Sam coughing] Are you all right? Are you sick? Couldn\\u2019t be better. Just tell me where you saw this glint. Yeah, no one\\u2019s gonna take a shot from there. What\\u2019s that? Is that a clue? Right now, it\\u2019s just an empty pack of cigarettes. Well, they haven\\u2019t been here very long. Really? Yeah, it was windy last night, so if the pack was here before, it would\\u2019ve been covered in leaves. Interesting theory. Okay, tell me what you saw in the chapel. I\\u2019m really hungry. Teresa. Helena said she\\u2019s making me ravioli. What did you see in the chapel? I told you. That monk fellow hit the mother superior and then we all ran away. Yeah, you said that before, and you were very convincing, but someone locked the kids in the closet, and this morning, someone took a shot at you. At me? To scare you, to keep you from talking, which means you either saw something you shouldn\\u2019t have seen or you know something you shouldn\\u2019t know. Why did Philippe come running to you? I\\u2019m his daughter. You\\u2019re his daughter, yet he didn\\u2019t feel the need to fill you in on who shot him and why? He was protecting me from knowing things I shouldn\\u2019t. Protecting you how? By then, just leaving you alone? [Birds chirping] My father didn\\u2019t come to see me. He was there to meet someone else, one of the sisters. Which one? The new one, soeur Angelique. Then his plans changed when he got shot. [Locket clatters] Yeah, that\\u2019s them. \\u201cThem\\u201d? What, the kid was with her? No, he came a month later with Papa. So, Philippe shows up wounded, with a kid, and tells you what? To hide the boy while he found a place to stay and got patched up. He said he\\u2019d come back for us in a day. He leaves the kid with you, takes off, and the monk comes knocking. [Birds chirping] I was hiding Zahid in the tower when I heard the kids screaming. [Children screaming] They were running from the chapel. They said a priest hit\\u2026 [In French] mother superior. So, you didn\\u2019t actually see him hit her like you\\u2019ve been saying? No. Then what? You locked the kids in the closet? To keep them safe. [Door slams] [Key rattles] Shh, shh! I ran back to my room. And heard the first gunshot. [Gun fires] [Monk speaking in French] The monk was shouting. [Monk and nuns whispering in French] He was telling soeur Angelique that she had to watch while he asked each of them where the boy was. [Gun clicks] [Monk speaking in French] And when they wouldn\\u2019t say\\u2026 [Gun fires] he shot them\\u2026 one by one. [Nuns whispering in French] [Gun clicks] [Monk talking in French language] [Nun screams] [Gun fires] [Teresa panting] [Nun moans] [Gun fires] [Gun clicking] [Nun screams] [Gun fires] [Nun screams] [Gun fires] I tried to close my eyes, but I couldn\\u2019t look away. And then\\u2026 Then what? He saw me. [Gasping] [Thuds] [Teresa panting] [Monk grunts] [Knife scrapes] So, you told him where the boy was? No. You weren\\u2019t afraid? I had my knife. Well, sadly, I lost it. In the chapel? In the monk. [Knife stabs] [Monk screams] [Squelches] [Footsteps thudding] [Door slams] I ran to the bell tower, but the boy was gone. Who is this kid that someone would kill six people to find him? I don\\u2019t know. But right before he killed her\\u2026 Soeur Angelique said something. The Mahdi? What the hell has your father gotten you into? [Suspenseful orchestral music] [Suspenseful orchestral music continues] [Wood clatters] [Suspenseful orchestral music intensifies] \\u266a \\u266a \\u266a\\u266aLet\\u2019s play a game, you and I, called \\u201cI won\\u2019t lie to Sam.\\u201d \\u266a We got a meeting with the bishop. Want to come along? As long as no one asks me to confess. Mr. Spade, do you have any specific information you want to share? I just did. I need to find Philippe. [Chuckles] If I want you dead, I just have to wait. [Telephone rings] You want to have a real conversation, knock on my door. \\u266a \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Your email address will not be published.
